The only rules are those set forth by the author. The speculative nature of the genre inspires thought and plants seeds that have led to advances in science. The genre can spark an interest in the sciences and is cited as the impetus for the career choice of many scientists. It is a playing field to explore social perspectives, predictions of the future, and engage in adventures unbound into the richness of the human mind. ( Summary by A.

Read in English by LibriVox volunteers. The Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern, is a work of enormous proportions. Setting out with the simple goal of offering ""American households a mass of good reading"", the editors drew from literature of all times and all kinds what they considered the best pieces of human writing, and compiled an ambitious collection of 45 volumes (with a 46th being an index-guide). Besides the selection and translation of a huge number of poems, letters, short stories and sections of books, the collection offers, before each chapter, a short essay about the author or subject in question. In many cases, chapters contemplate not one author, but certain groups of works, organized by nationality, subject or period; there is, thus, a chapter on Accadian-Babylonian literature, one on the Holy Grail, and one on Chansons, for example.

It was memorable to hear this incomparable devine when he preached. It was often even more memorable to hear him pray. Prayer was the instinct of his soul, and the atmosphere of his life. It was his ""vital breath"" and ""native air."" How naturally he inhaled and exhaled it! The greatness of his prayers more and more impresses and delights me. He touched every note. He sped as on eagle's wings, into the Heaven of God. May many be enabled, through grace, by the study of these prayers, to pray more abundantly and for effectually!

""He who wishes to grow strong in his religious life, let him, I say, next to the Bible, feed himself on the great Creeds of the Church. There is a force of religious inspiration in them which you will seek in vain elsewhere. And this for good reasons. First, because it is ever true that it is by the truth that sanctification is wrought. And next, because the truth is set forth in these Creeds with a clearness and richness with which it is set forth nowhere else.

Read by Warren Kati The Able McLaughlins won the Pulitzer Prize for a novel in 1924 in Margaret Wilson's debut work. Aptly described as ""Little House on the Prairie - but for adults"" the novel follows a group of Scottish families who pioneer the Iowa prairie in the 1860’s. The main storyline concerns Wully, the eldest McLaughlin son, who returns home from the Civil War to find that his sweetheart, Chirstie, has experienced an unspeakable tragedy that will profoundly affect the couple's lives. Their story is one of shame and honor, secrets and guilt, fear and loathing, revenge and forgiveness. But perhaps the stars of the novel are the strong older women such as Wully’s mother, Isobel, whose love and matriarchal strength keeps the family together as well as Chirstie’s stepmother, Barbara, who finds ways to make her good-for-nothing husband keep his promises.

Read in English by Kate Follis A novel with some utopian elements, but primarily dystopian. A French doctor and a German professor both inherit a vast fortune as descendants of a French soldier who married the rich widow of an Indian prince. They both decide to go to America and establish their own ""ideal"" society. Dr. Sarrasin, the French doctor, is focused on maintaining public health. He builds Ville-France. Professor Schultze, the German scientist, is a bit of a militarist and racist. He builds Stahlstadt and devotes his city to the production of ever more powerful weapons so that he can destroy Sarrasin's city. They manage to get the US to cede sovereignty to two cities so that the two newly rich men can create their utopia. The setting for Ville-France would place it on the Oregon Coast, near Bandon, Oregon. The location for the second city, Stahlstadt, is less clear, but the...";['Jules Verne'];2021-10-31T00:00:00Z;['eng'];71530;1086394625;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'Jules Verne', 'utopia', 'dystopia', 'Oregon'];audio;https://archive.org/details/the_begums_fortune_2110_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, Jules Verne, utopia, dystopia, Oregon;2021-10-31;5;71530;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/the_begums_fortune_2110_librivox/BegumsFortune_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (176MB)'}]

Considerado tanto una obra maestra teológica como literaria, el libro de Job es una discusión honesta de por qué Dios permite que la gente buena sufra. La prueba de la fe de Job, permitida por Dios en respuesta a un desafío de Satanás, reveló la soberanía amorosa de Dios y la supremacía de la sabiduría divina sobre la sabiduría humana (personificada por los cuatro amigos de Job). Creyendo que Dios es bueno a pesar de la aparente evidencia de lo contrario, Job descansó sólo en la fe. En lo más profundo de la agonía, aún podía proclamar: “Sé que mi Redentor vive” (19:25). Al final, Dios silenció todas las discusiones con la verdad de que solo Él es sabio (capítulos 38-41). Sin embargo, reivindicó la confianza de Job en él (capítulo 42), demostrando que la fe genuina no puede ser destruida.

93;arabella_stuart_2112_librivox;Arabella Stuart;LibriVox recording of Arabella Stuart by George Payne Rainsford James. Read in English by Lynne T Lady Arabella Stuart was an English noblewoman at the beginning of the seventeenth century. At one time considered to be a possible successor to Elizabeth I, the crown eventually went to her cousin, the tyrannical James I. Our story begins in 1603, shortly after his ascension to the throne. Apparently she was happy at the change in fortune, although relations with her kinsman deteriorated after her clandestine marriage, which was incorrectly seen as a power struggle. Even her closest friends could not protect her. In James's usual fashion, this is a colorful fictional account of her life.

Éste le anuncia que esa misma noche le visitarán tres espíritus más: los de las navidades pasadas, presentes y futuras, con el propósito de hacerle recapacitar sobre su vida y el sentido de las fiestas.

Fletcher, centering on why a former high-level police official was murdered, and on whether - and if so how - the murder was linked to two glamorous and high-profile sisters, one of whose photo was found in the dead man's pocket. As usual, Fletcher creates a number of different detectives -- a lawyer, his assistant, several policemen, a police spy, and even the dead man's granddaughter -- following various lines of inquiry. These lines converge rapidly in the last few chapters, when the author lets the reader weave them together into a coherent whole: the solution to the mystery.

Although the novels Austen became known for were not published until she was in her thirties, she was an active writer from the age of twelve, frequently composing epistolary works such as Lesley Castle. Austen eventually compiled 29 of her early writings in three notebooks that became known as the Juvenilia and that she called “Volume the First”, “Volume the Second”, and “Volume the Third”, including Lesley Castle in “Volume the Second”. Lesley Castle is set contemporaneously to Austen’s writing and consists of a series of ten letters by five characters, all of whom are women of high society living in Great Britain. In this short work, Austen employs a mock serious tone to humorously critique her peers on subjects such as self-absorption and jealousy.

In a nutshell, this work theorizes about why (Greek) spectators enjoy watching actors in a long series of scenes that depict human suffering (i.e., tragedy). It is a curious question, especially at the time since scholars generally thought of the Greeks as ""A race of men, well-fashioned, beautiful, envied, life-inspiring, like no other race hitherto"" (per Nietzsche's introduction). What did they need tragedy for? The question itself, and the path Nietzsche takes to answer this question, outraged the academic world.

Communism and Free Enterprise (Democracy) were locked in a ferocious struggle to prove that their political ideology was the best form of government for human kind. No holds were barred in this fight; propaganda was poured forth by both sides in a constant push to be seen as better, more progressive, more productive. Nuclear war was a constant threat. I know, I lived through that time. Thankfully the world came through that stressful time without a hot war but the question was not really settled: which is the better system? This story explores that question. ""Hardly had man solved his basic problems on the planet of his origin than he began to fumble into space.

The only rules are those set forth by the author. The speculative nature of the genre inspires thought and plants seeds that have led to advances in science. The genre can spark an interest in the sciences and is cited as the impetus for the career choice of many scientists.

It was meant for the consideration of the Scottish Parliament, but the ideas it contained fundamentally altered economics, politics, finance, and, consequently, the modern world.

(Translated by The Fathers of the English Dominican Province.) Read in English by M.S.C. Lambert, LC The Summa Contra Gentiles was composed by Thomas Aquinas between 1259 and 1265, in four books broadly covering teachings on God, on Creation, on Providence, and on tenets specific to Christianity. This Summa is not to be confused with his final Summa, the Summa Theologiae. The latter is specifically ""theological"" and directed to a Christian audience (hence Summa ""Theologica""), whereas the former, as the ""Contra Gentiles"" indicates, is directed toward ""non-Christian"" thinking. Implicitly a defence of the Catholic Christian faith, the first three books constitute a sort of rational apology of Christian thought, where philosophical arguments are deployed to defend Christian beliefs and usually only evoke Scripture in a latter instance to show its concordance with these largely-rational conclusions;...";['Saint Thomas Aquinas'];2021-05-22T00:00:00Z;['eng'];26801;1611754398;['librivox', 'audiobooks'];audio;https://archive.org/details/summacontragentiles1_2105_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, ;2021-05-22;5;26801;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/summacontragentiles1_2105_librivox/SummaContraGentiles1_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (262MB)'}]

Science fiction is a genre encompassing imaginative works that take place in this world or that of the author’s creation where anything is possible. The only rules are those set forth by the author. The speculative nature of the genre inspires thought and plants seeds that have led to advances in science. The genre can spark an interest in the sciences and is cited as the impetus for the career choice of many scientists. It is a playing field to explore social perspectives, predictions of the future, and engage in adventures unbound into the richness of the human mind. - Summary by Amy Gramour For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page...";['Various'];2021-11-20T00:00:00Z;['eng'];78604;1066454076;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'satire', 'murder', 'Mars', 'martians', 'time travel', 'space travel', 'dystopia', 'planet', 'speculative fiction', 'relationship', 'dramatist', 'extraterrestrial beings', 'human-alien encounters'];audio;https://archive.org/details/ssf_083_2111_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, satire, murder, Mars, martians, time travel, space travel, dystopia, planet, speculative fiction, relationship, dramatist, extraterrestrial beings, human-alien encounters;2021-11-20;4;78604;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/ssf_083_2111_librivox/SSFC083_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (180MB)'}]

There was no one like his to placate rich uncles or indignant mammas. He said just the right thing at just the right moment. What did it matter that Jeeves was somewhat of a tyrant, and that without his approval Bertie could not grow so much as a moustache? Was he not always there to lean on in moments of stress? And moments such as these were frequent in the life of Bertie and his friends. Jeeves service was extended to them all. ""Carry On, Jeeves"" is a collection of ten short stories, many of which had previously appeared in the Saturday Evening Post, and some were rewritten versions of stories in the collection My Man Jeeves.

(Translated by Maximilian August Mugge.) Read by John Van Stan “The essays contained in this volume treat of various subjects. With the exception of perhaps one we must consider all these papers as fragments. Written during the early Seventies, and intended mostly as prefaces, they are extremely interesting, since traces of Nietzsche's later tenets—like Slave and Master morality, the Superman—can be found everywhere. But they are also very valuable on account of the young philosopher's daring and able handling of difficult and abstruse subjects. ""Truth and Falsity,"" and ""The Greek Woman"" are probably the two essays which will prove most attractive to the average reader.” - Summary by Maximilian Mügge, Translator For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

The genre can spark an interest in the sciences and is cited as the impetus for the career choice of many scientists.

Dumas concurre a una cena en casa de Rossini el célebre compositor y gran chef italiano. En esa cena se encuentra con otros destacados artistas y se menciona la posibilidad de hacer una obra en conjunto pero de una manera desacostumbrada: se haría primero la música, luego se determinaría la historia y finalmente se redactarían las letras de los actos de la obra musical. El tema a desarrollar entra en discusión ya que se propone una temática, que a priori, no es la deseable para una obra italiana sino para un ambiente más nórdico. A continuación en los tres capítulos siguientes se narra la historia, que no llegó a ser una obra consumada pues Rossini compuso la obertura pero nunca realizó la partitura.

171;taleoftwocities_2104_librivox;A Tale of Two Cities;LibriVox recording of A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. Read by rreiman Charles Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities is a novel that views the eighteenth century French Revolution through the lens of nineteenth century Victorian Romanticism. Dickens tells the story of a wide range of characters in London and Paris whose lives intersect in the turbulence of the revolution. Unusual among his novels, A Tale of Two Cities relies heavily on plot rather than characterization. The moralism so typical of Dickens is much in evidence, however, as the author stages his story in the most violent period of the revolution, the Reign of Terror (1792-1794). It is very much a tale of good versus evil, with Dickens essentially realizing in fiction the historian Thomas Carlyle’s now-discredited interpretation of the French Revolution as a struggle between oppressed poor and monstrous aristocrats.

Little did Alan, Ned and Buck suspect what they were getting themselves in for when they approached the editor of The Herald with their plan to re-employ the Ocean Flyer, flying it back across the Atlantic Ocean to rescue their friend and the newspaper’s reporter, Bob Russell, from the clutches of the German military, who had taken him prisoner, accused him of spying, and, possibly, might condemn him to face a firing squad in the early days of “The Great War” in Europe during 1914. All they knew was they had to do something to help Bob and, hopefully, Mr. Latimer, managing editor of The Herald, would help.

Then we join our three adventurers in their huge projectile as they gather themselves after the shock of being fired at the Moon from the Columbiad cannon. Perhaps in a nod to Yankee exceptionalism, Verne permits them an extraordinary encounter in space, and better yet – to survive it! But that encounter has a lasting effect: despite all the careful preparations to deposit the projectile on the Moon, it appears the travelers are destined to miss it!

They will encounter a cave, and gypsies, and other things I won't tell you about. You can find out by listening to this book! As with many children's books written during this time in history, there are racial stereotypes that would not pass muster today. To edit them out would be to erase history, so I'm reading the book, as is. There is a ""fat black mammy"" named Dinah, and gypsies (of undetermined geographical origin) who naturally steal because they don't know any better.

194;donjuan_2110_librivox;Don Juan Tenorio;LibriVox recording of Don Juan Tenorio by José Zorrilla y Moral. Read in Spanish by Epachuko. Vive a la orilla del Guadalquivir una fuerza que desafía al Cielo. No puede respetar nada que le sea ajeno. Escarnio de los hombres, las mujeres, la justicia y la fe. Brilla su acero y se estremece si un alma arrebata, hincha su pecho si la virtud de una mujer maltrata, se burla en la cara de una ley que no le atrapa y desprecia el poder de un Dios que no le ata. Insolente, fanfarrón, iracundo y provocador. Cuando su fama es tan grande como su orgullo y su nombre es ya una leyenda, Don Juan se enfrenta a un amor que le desarma.

La historia de El huésped secreto se abre con una minuciosa descripción del momento previo a la partida, del instante en que está por comenzar el viaje. El bar­co ha sido remolcado desde el puerto hasta la desem­bocadura del río Menam y desde allí, emprenderá el viaje cuando el viento se lo permita. El narrador protagonista de esta historia se encuen­tra en el umbral de la próxima experiencia: todos los preparativos para zarpar ya se han realizado, todo está listo; pero todavía no se ha iniciado el viaje. Desde la primera persona, el capitán ofrece sus impresiones so­bre la situación. Indica con precisión la posición en la que se encuentra y lo que observa a derecha, a izquier­da y al volverse hacia atrás. Ese estado inicial de la tra­vesía es definido como una pausa, en la que la soledad, la inmovilidad, el silencio, el atardecer son los rasgos...";['Joseph Conrad'];2021-12-26T00:00:00Z;['spa'];136918;338096134;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'conrad', 'leggatt'];audio;https://archive.org/details/huespedsecreto_2112_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, conrad, leggatt;2021-12-26;2;136918;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/huespedsecreto_2112_librivox/HuespedSecreto_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (56MB)'}]

(Book subtitle) Bourke was a Medal of Honor awardee in the American Civil War whose subsequent Army career included several campaigns in the Indian wars of the mid to late 19th century in the American West. He wrote prolifically. He was mostly free of the unfortunate disdain for Native Americans common in 19th century America. He was quite admiring of many aspects of the Native American. “… Bourke had the opportunity to witness every facet of life in the Old West—the battles, wildlife, the internal squabbling among the military, the Indian Agency, settlers, and Native Americans.” - Summary by David Wales For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox...;['John Gregory Bourke'];2021-04-20T00:00:00Z;['eng'];42824;394199455;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'Native Americans', 'Mexico', 'nineteenth century', 'apache', 'Arizona', 'american indians', 'new mexico', 'u.s. army', 'indian wars', 'chiricahua', 'sierra madre mountains'];audio;https://archive.org/details/an_apache_campaign_2104_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, Native Americans, Mexico, nineteenth century, apache, Arizona, american indians, new mexico, u.s. army, indian wars, chiricahua, sierra madre mountains;2021-04-20;4;42824;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/an_apache_campaign_2104_librivox/ApacheCampaignSierraMadre_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (64MB)'}]

And David Copperfield, like other of Dickens' works, emphasizes thematically that love and sacrifice are better than greed and arrogance.

220;castle_otranto2_2111_librivox;The Castle of Otranto;LibriVox recording of The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole. Read in English by Thomas A. Copeland The Castle of Otranto is regarded as the first Gothic novel, a genre appealing to a taste for terror and set in a remote past when prodigies and magic can be imagined to have existed, with violent contrasts between purity and ungoverned passions. The author represents the tale as having been translated from a black letter Italian volume of the 15th century but describing much earlier events. This fictional antiquity and the depiction of mysterious wonders, dark subterranean passages, fearsome apparitions, marvelous coincidences, and especially a savage threat to spotless innocence are all typical of this genre, which does not assure a reader of a happy ending.

Conrad biographer Maya Janasoff has argued that while Marlow's descriptions of Africans are crudely racist, the author binds this racist language with ""a potentially radical suggestion. What made the difference between savagery and civilization, Conrad was saying, transcended skin color; it even transcended place. The issue for Conrad wasn’t that 'savages' were inhuman.

And then- que voulez vous? He did not guide the star of destiny."" On his last night in Valrosa, Saltash (Charles Rex) returns to his luxurious yacht to find a stowaway, a young woman disguised as a boy. She pleads to be kept by him in order to escape from her abuser. Although ill used by life she is still very pure and Saltash falls head over heels in love with her.

Read in English by 3200runner; Joan Freeman; Dory In all history, there is no drama of more terrible interest than that which terminated with the total destruction of Jerusalem. Had the whole Jewish nation joined in the desperate resistance made, by a section of it, to the overwhelming strength of Rome, the world would have had no record of truer patriotism than that displayed, by this small people, in their resistance to the forces of the mistress of the world. Unhappily, the reverse of this was the case. Except in the defense of Jotapata and Gamala, it can scarcely be said that the Jewish people, as a body, offered any serious resistance to the arms of Rome. The defenders of Jerusalem were a mere fraction of its population--a fraction composed almost entirely of turbulent characters and robber bands, who fought with the fury of desperation; after having placed themselves beyond the pale of...";['G.

Dentro de su bibliografía, se encuentra hacia el final de su producción. Para algunos analistas de la obra de Tolstói, esta historia reflejaría las luchas intelectuales y espirituales que poco tiempo atrás el autor había atravesado, en la crisis que tuvo cuando alcanzó los 50 años y que superaría con un radical cambio espiritual. En la novela, los temas tratados son la naturaleza tanto de la vida como de la muerte. La novela fue aclamada en sendas ocasiones por Vladímir Nabókov y por Mahatma Gandhi como la más grande de toda la literatura rusa.

Read in English by PhyllisV A short, semi-autobiographical work by American humorist Mark Twain. It explores the controversy over the authorship of the Shakespearean literary canon via satire, anecdote, and extensive quotation of contemporary authors on the subject. In the book, Twain expounds the view that Shakespeare of Stratford was not the author of the canon, and lends tentative support to the Baconian theory. The book opens with a scene from his early adulthood, where he was trained to be a steamboat pilot by an elder who often argued with him over the controversy. Twain's arguments include the following points: That little was known about Shakespeare's life, and the bulk of his biographies were based on conjecture. That a number of eminent British barristers and judges found Shakespeare's plays permeated with precise legal thought, and that the author could only have been a veteran legal professional. That in contrast,...;['Mark Twain'];2021-10-16T00:00:00Z;['eng'];30184;505243480;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'satire', 'shakespeare authorship question', 'semi-autobiography'];audio;https://archive.org/details/isshakespearedead_2110_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, satire, shakespeare authorship question, semi-autobiography;2021-10-16;1;30184;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/isshakespearedead_2110_librivox/IsShakespeareDead_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (81MB)'}]

252;almayers_folly_2112_librivox;Almayer's Folly;LibriVox recording of Almayer's Folly by Joseph Conrad. Read in English by Peter Dann Joseph Conrad was born in former Poland, spent part of his childhood exiled in Russia because of his father's Polish nationalist political activities, learned and read French early, and did not speak a word of English until his late teens. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that when Conrad came to write this, his first novel, it centred on the pain of having a contested sense of identity, the experience of having to choose, in the midst of argument and derision, whether one was really 'this or that'. The Almayer of the story is a morose and hapless trader of Dutch extraction, settled in shambolic poverty on a river in Borneo. He dreams of finding gold inland and taking his mixed-race daughter Nina triumphantly to the Netherlands, where neither of them has ever been. Nina and her strong-willed Filipina mother, however, prove to have quite different loyalties and a quite different plan — though this...;['Joseph Conrad'];2021-12-10T00:00:00Z;['eng'];31882;1145821600;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'psychological fiction', 'dutch borneo fiction', 'imperialism fiction', 'trading companies fiction', 'tom lingard (fictitious character) fiction', 'borneo fiction'];audio;https://archive.org/details/almayers_folly_2112_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, psychological fiction, dutch borneo fiction, imperialism fiction, trading companies fiction, tom lingard (fictitious character) fiction, borneo fiction;2021-12-10;1;31882;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/almayers_folly_2112_librivox/AlmayersFolly3_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (186MB)'}]

Read in English by Peter Dann In the 1870s, supporters of the pretender to the throne of Spain take advantage of a young man's attraction to the sea to persuade him to run dangerous missions on their behalf, with the financial support of a beautiful but exceedingly baffling young heiress, with whom the young man is soon giddily in love. Told largely in the first person, the novel is unusual, for Conrad, in focusing largely on the evolving psychology of a young man in the throes of a great romantic passion.

A small child was given the responsibility of selecting which of three rebel leaders of a civil uprising would receive a death penalty. The unfortunate fate was given to Poyer who was shot in front of a large crowd at Covent Garden. In 1883 Twain read about the child's role in the execution in a copy of Carlyle's Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell, (Wiley & Putnam, 1845, pp. 344-345). In his personal notebook, Twain's imagination led him to remark, ""By dramatic accident, it could have been his own child"" (Notebook #22, reprinted in Mark Twain's Notebooks & Journals, Volume III, 1883-1891, p. 14). In December 1883, Twain wrote his friend William Dean Howells, ""Now let's write a tragedy"" (Mark Twain-Howells Letters, Volume II, p. 455).

He led 3 victorious wars (against Denmark, Austria and France) and achieved unification of Germany. However, he tried very hard to avoid unnecessary wars.

322;wayofpeacev3_2107_librivox;The Way of Peace (version 3);LibriVox recording of The Way of Peace (version 3) by James Allen. Read in English by Sonnie Abdalla ‘The Way of Peace’ is the second part of James Allen’s first published work titled ‘From Poverty to Power’ alternatively titled ‘The Realization of Prosperity and Peace’ (1901). Where part one focused more on the power an individual possesses over their circumstances and environment, part two dives deeper into that pathway which leads to what every soul inwardly seeks. The simplicity of these teachings make them accessible to everyone and invaluable to those with an interest in practical transcendentalism. Focusing on meditation and ascension without favouritism toward any school of thought or religion. ‘The Way of Peace’ explores and explains divine truths by drawing on examples from nature. Can be read on its own or as an extension to part one (titled ‘The Path to Prosperity’), this is a powerful volume which invites us to prove itself true through our own experiences and reflection....;['James Allen'];2021-07-28T00:00:00Z;['eng'];55080;372941096;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'prosperity', 'self-help', 'spirituality', 'law of attraction', 'motivation'];audio;https://archive.org/details/wayofpeacev3_2107_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, prosperity, self-help, spirituality, law of attraction, motivation;2021-07-28;64;55080;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/wayofpeacev3_2107_librivox/WayPeace3_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (59MB)'}]

Good entertaining stuff. But is it Shakespeare? The 1662 first printed edition of this play says it was written by William Shakespeare and William Rowley. It doesn't appear that anyone any longer believes that Shakespeare was actually involved, and probably this is entirely Rowley - who co-authored plays with a fair number of other authors of the period. Rowley also acted in London troupes, including Shakespeare's The King's Players, often in low comedy Clown parts he wrote for himself such as is found in this play. - Summary by ToddHW Cast list: Aurelius, King of Brittain: Mike Manolakes Vortiger, King of (Welsh) Brittain: Craig Franklin Uter Pendragon, the Prince, Brother to...";"['William Shakespeare; William Rowley']";2021-03-19T00:00:00Z;['eng'];49776;447926560;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'King Arthur', 'merlin', 'pendragon', 'shakespeare fake'];audio;https://archive.org/details/birthofmerlin_2103_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, King Arthur, merlin, pendragon, shakespeare fake;2021-03-19;7;49674;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/birthofmerlin_2103_librivox/BirthMerlin_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (73MB)'}]

The first half was written by Brackett and when she was pulled away by other commitments the publisher gave it to a new writer, Ray Bradbury, to finish. It is a sort of prequel to the Stark character developed by Brackett where a weak puny man is transferred into the body of a Conan like superman and then cruses through adventure after adventure, always rescuing damsels who are tough and feisty. The publisher blurb says ""He died—and then awakened in a new body. He found himself on a world of bizarre loveliness, a powerful, rich man. He took pleasure in his turn of good luck ... until he discovered that his new body was hated by all on this strange planet, that his soul was owned by Rann, devil-goddess of Falga, who was using him for her own gain."" - Summary...";['Leigh Douglass Brackett & Ray Bradbury'];2021-04-29T00:00:00Z;['eng'];31356;490964838;['librivox', 'audiobooks'];audio;https://archive.org/details/loreleioftheredmist_2104_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, ;2021-04-29;9;31356;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/loreleioftheredmist_2104_librivox/LoreleiRedMist2_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (78MB)'}]

It came 14 years after Twain's death and so, ""speaking from the grave"", he felt he could be ""as frank and free and unembarrassed as a love letter"". The autobiographical chapters that he published years earlier in the North American Review, were selected more for their acceptability and potential popularity than for their completely true reflection of his inner thoughts.

In un teatro, in cui si sta provando una rappresentazione, irrompono sei ""personaggi"" che dotati di vita reale cercano un autore che gli permetta di realizzare e rappresentare il loro dramma. Quest'opera teatrale fu rappresentata per la prima volta il 9 maggio 1921 al teatro Valle di Roma (dunque nel 2021 ricorre il centesimo anniversario), ma in quell'occasione ebbe un esito tempestoso, perché molti spettatori contestarono la rappresentazione, sorpresi dalla novità della stessa che rappresenta il teatro nel teatro e uno dei primi esempi di teatro dell’assurdo. Successivamente l’opera ebbe il meritato successo. L'opera non è divisa in atti, per espressa indicazione dell'autore, ma l'azione è interrotta comunque in due punti che creano una naturale divisione dell'opera in tre parti. - Summary by Pier Personaggi e interpreti: Il narratore: Pier Il padre: Giovanni La madre:...";['Luigi Pirandello'];2021-02-09T00:00:00Z;['ita'];35153;418401611;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'teatro', 'finzione', 'realtà', 'assurdo', 'Italiano'];audio;https://archive.org/details/sei_personaggi_in_cerca_dautore_2102_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, teatro, finzione, realtà, assurdo, Italiano, ;2021-02-09;6;35153;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/sei_personaggi_in_cerca_dautore_2102_librivox/6Personaggi_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (69MB)'}]

While his pupil went off to conquer the world, Aristotle returned to Athens and founded his school, the Lyceum. There he amassed the first great collection of plants and animals and laid the foundations of biology, logic, literary theory, ethics, and political science. Departing from abstract Platonic universals, Aristotle described such natural processes as the developing embryo of the chick. He saw the universe as matter in motion with God as its first impulsive force. Aristotle was skeptical of Utopias. Social evils do not ""arise out of the possession of private property,"" he wrote, but ""from quite another source--the wickedness of human nature.""

In 1861, just after the outbreak of the American Civil War, Motley wrote two letters to The Times defending the Federal position, and these letters, afterwards reprinted as [this] pamphlet entitled Causes of the Civil War in America, made a favourable impression on President Lincoln. Partly owing to this essay, Motley was appointed United States minister to the Austrian Empire in 1861, a position which he filled with distinction, working with other American diplomats such as John Bigelow and Charles Francis Adams to help prevent European intervention on the side of the Confederacy in the American Civil War. He resigned this position in 1867.

Read in English by Tom Denholm The Mill on the Floss is George Eliot’s second novel, and was published in 1860, only a year after her first, Adam Bede. It centres on the lives of brother and sister Tom and Maggie Tulliver growing up on the river Floss near the town of St. Oggs (a fictionalised version of Gainsborough, in Lincolnshire, England) in the years following the Napoleonic Wars, with both as young adults eventually meeting a tragic end by the Mill which the family holds so dear. In large measure, their lives are dominated by their father, a successful miller brought down by his inability to resist settling arguments in a court of law. Character differences between Tom and Maggie - he dour and rigid of thought, she lively and impulsive - seem to matter little in childhood, but eventually strain their relationship beyond breaking point. It is Maggie, however, who is the dominant character of the book,...;['George Eliot'];2021-05-16T00:00:00Z;['eng'];35750;4269666172;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'fiction'];audio;https://archive.org/details/the_mill_on_the_floss_ver2_2105_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, fiction;2021-05-16;5;35750;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/the_mill_on_the_floss_ver2_2105_librivox/MillFloss01-32_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 01-32 (357MB)'}, {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/the_mill_on_the_floss_ver2_2105_librivox/MillFloss33-63_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 33-63 (350MB)'}]

Emily Byrd Starr longs to attend Queen's Academy to earn her teaching license, but her tradition-bound relatives at New Moon refuse. She is instead offered the chance to go to Shrewsbury High School with her friends, on two conditions. The first is that she board with her disliked Aunt Ruth, but it is the second that causes Emily difficulties. Emily must not write a word during her high-school education. From the author of Anne of Green Gables, Emily Climbs carries forward the story of the lovable little heroine whom a multitude of readers met in Emily of New Moon.

363;historymodernphilosophy_2101_librivox;History of Modern Philosophy;LibriVox recording of History of Modern Philosophy by Alfred William Benn. Read in English by Pamela Nagami This book is a brief, but cogent discussion of Western philosophy-- from Francis Bacon and Giordano Bruno through Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz, Hume, Berkeley and Kant, the German idealists and Hegel, and ending with such nineteenth century luminaries as Mill, Spencer, and Nietzsche. Enchanted with Copernicus, Bruno goes to the stake for positing an infinity of inhabited worlds. Descartes, a professed skeptic, manages to justify everything the Jesuits taught him at La Flèche, while Spinoza, in mystical awe, envisions a pantheistic cosmos in which thought and extension are one and the same thing--God. The British philosopher, A.W. Benn, presents each thinker biographically and within the context of his philosophical predecessors and contemporaries.

Subtitled ""Fifty Years' March of the Republic,"" this is steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie's love letter to America, first published in 1886, an impassioned celebration of the American success story, and a call for other nations to follow in America's footsteps. Through simple, direct discussions of the nature of the American character and her jobs and education, religion, industry, art and literature, foreign affairs, and more, Carnegie sets out a case for a brand of conservative democracy for the world to emulate. Carnegie was born in Scotland and emigrated to America as a teenager. His Carnegie Steel Company launched the steel industry in Pittsburgh, and after its sale to J.P. Morgan, he devoted his life to philanthropic causes. His charitable organizations built more than 2,500 public libraries around the world, and gave away more than $350 million during his lifetime. - Summary by...";['Andrew Carnegie'];2021-03-16T00:00:00Z;['eng'];38860;2537957967;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'economics', 'American history', 'history', 'education', 'America', 'immigration', 'poverty', 'mining', 'transportation', 'newspapers', 'government', 'democracy'];audio;https://archive.org/details/triumphantdemocracy_2103_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, economics, American history, history, education, America, immigration, poverty, mining, transportation, newspapers, government, democracy;2021-03-16;9;38860;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/triumphantdemocracy_2103_librivox/TriumphantDemocracy00-15_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 00-15 (238MB)'}, {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/triumphantdemocracy_2103_librivox/TriumphantDemocracy16-30_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 16-30 (182MB)'}]

In it, Carpenter argues for the legitimization of “uranianism,” recounts the history of homosexuality from antiquity to present day, highlights the great social and aesthetic work done by Uranians, and outlines some of the transformative social effects that might occur from a greater acceptance of homosexuality.

A vivid description of wealth and poverty in Russia in Tolstoy's day, an inquiry into the root causes of economic inequality, and a vision of a more just way of living. Tolstoy recounts his own disturbing encounters with extreme poverty in Moscow, his initial idea of making the problem disappear by generous financial contributions, and his subsequent realization that the problem of poverty was much more intractable than he had imagined. He concludes that poverty is fundamentally linked with the luxurious lifestyle to which he and his class were accustomed, and that both are detrimental both to the rich and to the poor. He goes on to investigate the roots of power imbalances, both in the state and in markets, and to make suggestions for a fundamental social and economic reform in the interest of justice and well-being.

373;sirgawain_2112_librivox;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight;LibriVox recording of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight by Jessie Laidlay Weston. Read in English by Thomas A. Copeland. This poem celebrates Christmas by exploring the mystery of Christ's mission on earth: his death, resurrection, and second coming as judge of all human souls. Sir Gawain is cast in the role of Everyman. At the feast of the New Year, an unarmed green giant rides his green horse into the banqueting hall of King Arthur and challenges any member of the assembled company to behead him with a huge axe and then to submit to the same treatment from his victim the next year.

As the novel bleakly, but with occasional streaks of humour, sifts the hidden motives of London anarchists and revolutionaries, police and government officials, and indeed of Verloc and his own immediate family, nearly all emerge, in their own way, as secret agents of a kind, not quite who they purport to be.

In 1912 textile workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, mostly immigrants, went on strike in response to a pay cut, speedups, and unsafe working conditions. Representatives from the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW/Wobblies) came in to help organize the strike. The city declared martial law and a tense standoff went on for weeks. National newspapers provided breathless coverage of the strike and painted drastically different pictures of what was happening and who was to blame. When a woman was shot in ambiguous circumstances, strike leaders were tried for murder--not for shooting her, but for purportedly inciting mob violence leading to her death. They were acquitted. This book by an ardent IWW member, which seems to have been written in haste as well as in great enthusiasm, gives a vivid journalistic account of labor conditions, of the strike which was afterward known as the Bread...;['Justus Ebert'];2021-05-18T00:00:00Z;['eng'];46927;582470546;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'history', 'socialism', 'immigrants', 'strike', 'labor', 'Union', 'iww', 'America'];audio;https://archive.org/details/trialofnewsociety_2105_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, history, socialism, immigrants, strike, labor, Union, iww, America, ;2021-05-18;2;46927;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/trialofnewsociety_2105_librivox/TrialNewSociety_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (97MB)'}]

Prothero and Stanley Leathes. From the preface: ""The present volume, as its title imports, relates a complicated series of conflicts of which the origin or the pretext has for the most part to be sought in the great religious schism with which the preceding volume was concerned. But the cause of the restoration of Catholic unity in the West was, in the minds of both the supporters and the opponents of that cause, inextricably interwoven with the purposes of dynastic ambition, and powerfully affected by the influences traceable to the rapid advance of the monarchical...";['Various'];2021-11-27T00:00:00Z;['eng'];50473;7337828452;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'tudors', 'ottoman empire', 'spanish armada', 'holy roman empire', 'valois', 'a. a. tilley', 'french humanism', 'a. j. butler', 'r. nisbet bain', 'the catholic reaction', 'báthory', 'moritz brosch', 'a. w. ward', 'george edmundson', 'thomas graves law', 'j. k. laughton', 'sidney lee', 'e. armstrong', 'ugo balzani', 'martin hume', 's. r. gardiner', 'r. dunlop'];audio;https://archive.org/details/cambridgemodernhistory3_2111_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, tudors, ottoman empire, spanish armada, holy roman empire, valois, a. a. tilley, french humanism, a. j. butler, r. nisbet bain, the catholic reaction, báthory, moritz brosch, a. w. ward, george edmundson, thomas graves law, j. k. laughton, sidney lee, e. armstrong, ugo balzani, martin hume, s. r. gardiner, r. dunlop;2021-11-27;11;50473;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/cambridgemodernhistory3_2111_librivox/CambridgeModernHistory301-24_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 01-24 (360MB)'}, {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/cambridgemodernhistory3_2111_librivox/CambridgeModernHistory325-46_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 25-46 (370MB)'}, {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/cambridgemodernhistory3_2111_librivox/CambridgeModernHistory347-69_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 47-69 (350MB)'}, {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/cambridgemodernhistory3_2111_librivox/CambridgeModernHistory370-77_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 70-77 (116MB)'}]

Ze weet hoe ze mannen moet charmeren en dat doet ze dan ook als ze er een ontmoet die haar intrigeert. Maar ze wordt tot die flirts gedreven door een wanhopig zoeken naar geluk. Ze hoopt zó dat het deze keer Echte Liefde is! Maar het is altijd vooral de nerveuze spanning en de energie die ze anders zo ontbeert. De bewondering en het vereren waar ze naar snakt bij haar man Egbert. De romances zetten haar aan tot werken (ze schrijft heel verdienstelijk) en om de beste versie van zichzelf te zijn. Maar ze lijdt onder haar wisselende gemoedsstemmingen en onder de burgermoraal die voorschrijft dat ze tevreden moet zijn met man en kind. Ze wil zó graag beter en hoger en méér, maar alles draait elke keer uit op teleurstelling.

Da umstritten ist, ob es sich um ein echtes Tagebuch handelt, oder ob die Herausgeberin auch die Verfasserin ist, sollte das Buch im Zweifel als fiktional betrachtet werden. Der Text ist ein Zeuge seiner Zeit, des frühen 20. Jahrhunderts, und enthält antisemitische und rassistische Ansichten und Begriffe, die als beleidigend empfunden werden können.

Read in English by Pamela Nagami In 395 A.D. Theodosius, the last ruler of the undivided Roman Empire died. To his young and incompetent son, Honorius, he left the government of its western half. Honorius depended upon the great general, Stilicho, to withstand the Visigoths under Alaric. But when he fecklessly abandoned his general to execution by palace intriguers, Alaric conquered and sacked Rome (410). Thus opened the era of chaotic leadership, social disintegration, and barbarian conquest, which used to be called the Dark Ages. The Franks emerged and helped to found the temporal power of the Papacy. Charlemagne consolidated a wide realm and revived learning. But his last years were overshadowed by the first incursions of the terrible Vikings, who in their shallow-draft vessels penetrated the Seine and the Loire into the heart of Gaul and, landing on the British coasts, conquered half of England. -...;['Richard William Church'];2021-01-09T00:00:00Z;['eng'];29188;1268350404;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'middle ages', 'Charlemagne', 'Franks', 'popes', 'Wessex', 'vikings', 'goths', 'arianism', 'barbarians', 'clovis', 'theodoric', 'lombards', 'saracens', 'justinian', 'huns', 'attila', 'fall of rome', 'alaric', 'vandals', 'burgundians', 'saxons and angles', 'carolingians'];audio;https://archive.org/details/beginningofthemiddleages_2101_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, middle ages, Charlemagne, Franks, popes, Wessex, vikings, goths, arianism, barbarians, clovis, theodoric, lombards, saracens, justinian, huns, attila, fall of rome, alaric, vandals, burgundians, saxons and angles, carolingians;2021-01-09;13;29188;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/beginningofthemiddleages_2101_librivox/BeginningMiddleAges_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (210MB)'}]

That parliamentarian's wife was loved as a girl by both Pisistratus' father and uncle; but she had passed them both by to make a marriage better suited to an ambitious woman. By a freak of fate, Pisistratus now falls in love with her daughter Fannie. Meanwhile, Pisistratus' uncle is estranged from his own son. Between each person's pride, the rift doesn't seem possible to settle. Pisistratus does what he can to heal the wounds and reunite the family. A further outline of this story would give no idea of its charm. The mutual affection of the Caxtons is finely indicated, and the gradations of light and shade make a beautiful picture.

The volume starts with the triggering event, i.e., the assassination of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand; then the author gave a general background of the world's political and social situations that contributed to the more deep-rooted cause to the final showdown between the antagonistic powers.

Read in Portuguese by Rachel Moraes Primeiro romance de Machado de Assis, publicado em 1872, quando o escritor tinha 33 anos. Segundo o autor, ao escrever este primeiro romance, depois de ter sido bem sucedido em contos, peças de teatro e artigos de jornal, ele colocava em prática um desafio de Shakespeare, expresso na cena 5 do primeiro ato de “Mérito por Mérito”:“São as nossas dúvidas uns traidores, que nos fazem perder muitas vezes o bem que poderíamos obter, incutindo-nos o receio de o tentar”.

From the author's introduction: ""The world Phil Gish lived in was not a pretty one, and Phil didn't enjoy living in it. He was disillusioned, purposeless, hopeless, and haunted by the fear that a robot would take over his job. But then Phil was a timid person, not much given to adventure seeking. If he hadn't been so mild he might have found his kicks at All Amusements, the syndicated playground where anyone could find fun, providing he had the proper sadistic and otherwise aberrated elements in his personality. But Phil was good—and bored. And then one day a cat perched on his window—not an ordinary cat—a green cat.

Hilbert's 20 axioms were first proposed by him in 1899 in his book Grundlagen der Geometrie as the foundation for a modern treatment of Euclidean geometry. Hilbert's axiom system is constructed with six primitive notions: the three primitive terms point, line , and plane , and the three primitive relations Betweenness (a ternary relation linking points), Lies on (or Containment, three binary relations between the primitive terms), and Congruence (two binary relations, one linking line segments and one linking angles.) The original monograph in German was based on Hilbert's own lectures and was organized by himself for a memorial address given in 1899.

That is not wholly wrong, yet many have seen in this novel's beguiling voice, innovative narrative technique, and acute depiction of erotic repression a literary masterpiece. In 2015, the BBC ranked The Good Soldier 13th on its list of the 100 greatest British novels.

Read in English by adamkoebel; In September 2013, Chief of Staff of the Army General Raymond T. Odierno directed the Operation Iraqi Freedom Study Group to research and write an operational history of the U.S. Army’s experience in the Iraq War from 2003 to 2011. This volume, The United States Army in the Iraq War, 2003-2006, is the first of two fulfilling that task. It tells the story of the U.S.-led campaigns to remove Saddam Hussein and his Iraqi Ba’athist regime from power in 2003 and to stabilize the country following those operations.

Read in English by Pamela Nagami In this Little Blue Book Number 512, Will Durant describes François-Marie Arouet, the writer, historian, and philosopher known as Voltaire (1694-1778) as ""unprepossessing, ugly, vain, flippant, unscrupulous, even at times dishonest"" and ""tirelessly kind, considerate, ...as sedulous in helping friends as in crushing enemies."" ""My trade is to say what I think,"" wrote Voltaire, and he did so in ninety-nine ""sparkling and fruitful"" volumes. He advocated for freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and for the separation of church and state. In 1791, when his ashes were carried through Paris to be re-entombed in the Panthéon, 100,000 men and women joined the procession, while 600,000 flanked the streets. Written on his funeral car were the words: ""He gave the human mind a great impetus; he prepared us for freedom.""

The Book of Tea is as much about philosophy, religion and art as it is about a drink made with dried leaves in boiling water. It traces the development of tea into teaism. The author’s first paragraph summarizes the whole book: “Tea began as a medicine and grew into a beverage. In China, in the eighth century, it entered the realm of poetry as one of the polite amusements. The fifteenth century saw Japan ennoble it into a religion of aestheticism--Teaism. Teaism is a cult founded on the adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence. It inculcates purity and harmony, the mystery of mutual charity, the romanticism of the social order. It is essentially a worship of the Imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.” The author shows that the philosophy of Teaism, which was developed from...;['Kakuzō Okakura'];2021-04-25T00:00:00Z;['eng'];49127;348771827;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'philosophy', 'zen', 'teaism'];audio;https://archive.org/details/bookoftea_2104_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, philosophy, zen, teaism;2021-04-25;15;49127;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/bookoftea_2104_librivox/BookTea_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (39MB)'}]

Read in English by thestorygirl; Larry Wilson; TJ Burns; Jasmin Salma; Wayne Cooke; Kelly S. Taylor; E.J. Lavery “Gulzara, The Persian Slave” is a rare example of a script for a Victorian melodrama that was intended as a private theatrical – to be performed by a limited cast of amateurs in a home or school, not on a public stage. Rarer still, “Gulzara” was written by a female author to be performed by a cast of women. The only male character, Amurath, was a “breeches role,” played by a young girl. Thus this drama, set in a harem in Constantinople, in addition to spinning a yarn about the abduction of Sultan Suliman’s son, gives us an unusual peek at the lives of young women in the U.S. in the 1840’s and 50’s. - Summary by Kelly S.

After the Roman conquest, the Celtic Gauls adopted Roman culture and speech. The Germanic invasions ultimately transformed France into a Catholic feudal society. In this short history, Mary Duclaux traces the emergence of towns, the rise of the French monarchy, the calamitous Hundred Years' War and the Wars of Religion. We meet Joan of Arc, Charles VII, the gallant Henry IV, and the Sun King, Louis XIV, who drove France to the brink of bankruptcy. In the second half of the book Duclaux gives us the French Revolution and the Age of Napoleon: Louis XVI, sunk in ""plump and smiling apathy,"" Marie Antoinette, who pleaded with France's enemies for rescue, the Paris mob who hated her, Danton, Saint-Just, Robespierre, and the Terror, and finally a sombre young Corsican officer with no small talk, the military and administrative genius, Napoleon Bonaparte.

This story of romance and deception thrilled Victorian audiences. In the 1840’s, the show served as a starring vehicle for the great William Macready and the incomparable Helene Faucit. The plot of “Lady of Lyons’” centers around the proud and beautiful Pauline Deschapelles.

All his writings betray a sour, monastic, harsh, and severe turn of mind. ""Touch not, taste not, handle not,"" might seem to have been the maxims of his religious conduct. The abilities of Tertullian, as an orator and a scholar, are far from being contemptible, and have doubtless given him a reputation to which his theological knowledge by no means entitles him. Yet the man seems always in good earnest, and therefore much more estimable than thousands who would take a pleasure in despising him, while they themselves are covered with profaneness.

For 3 days, from July 1 to 3, 1863, a gigantic struggle between 75,000 Confederates and 88,000 Union troops raged about the town and left 51,000 casualties in its wake. Heroic deeds were numerous on both sides, climaxed by the famed Confederate assault on July 3 which has become known throughout the world as Pickett’s Charge. The Union victory gained on these fields ended the last Confederate invasion of the North and marked the beginning of a gradual decline in Southern military power.

""In an age of excitement and prejudice, he set men the example of thinking calmly and clearly...At a time when the chains of dogma were far tighter, and the penalties of attempting to loosen them far more stringent, than it is now easy to conceive, he raised questions which stirred the very depths of human thought. And all this in a spirit so candid, so tolerant, so liberal, and so unselfish, that he seemed to be writing not for his own party or his own times, but for the future of knowledge and of mankind.""

Read in English by M.S.C. Lambert, LC The Summa Theologica (or the Summa Theologiae or simply the Summa, written 1265–1274) is the most famous work of Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225–1274) although it was never finished. It was intended as a manual for beginners and a compilation of all of the main theological teachings of that time.

This Maugham classic is set in England and Hong Kong and in a cholera --ridden Chinese village in the 1920's. A committed, principled, epidemiologist, Dr. Fane, falls in love with the beautiful, but vain and foolish, Kitty Garstin. She agrees to marry him only because she wishes to beat her sister to the altar. She soon commits adultery with a British official in Hong Kong, where they have relocated. Dr. Fane decides that she must accompany him to a small village, deep within China, where cholera is rampant; otherwise, he will reveal the betrayal, with grave consequences for all. It appears to be a suicide mission. The story is one of love, of a search for meaning of life, of forgiveness, and of personal growth and change. The inner thoughts of the several characters--especially Kitty--are thoroughly painted by Maugham. The title presumably refers to the veil of illusion that often hides the...";['W.

Cook published a memoir claiming his own discovery of the Pole, this short SciFi about the discovery of the Pole and the civilisation on the other side which is supposedly 6 centuries in advance compared to our own, was doomed to sink in the unknown from the beginning on. But reading it a century later, this SciFi shows its own charm by conveying the general sentiment in the society short before the big discovery and the motivation behind the continued exploration despite the associated hardships.

The blessed John the Evangelist spent the chief part of his time there: he was there when he was banished and there he died. It was there too that Paul left Timothy, as he says in writing to him, “As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus.” “Most of the philosophers also, those more particularly who flourished in Asia, were there; and even Pythagoras himself is said to have come from thence; perhaps because Samos, whence he really came, is an island of Ionia.

Read in English by David Ronald Against Celsus, preserved entirely in Greek, is a major apologetics work by the Church Father Origen of Alexandria, written in around 248 AD, countering the writings of Celsus, a pagan philosopher and controversialist who had written a scathing attack on Christianity in his treatise ""The True Word"". Among a variety of other charges, Celsus had denounced many Christian doctrines as irrational and criticized Christians themselves as uneducated, deluded, unpatriotic, close-minded towards reason, and too accepting of sinners. He had accused Jesus of performing his miracles using black magic rather than actual divine powers and of plagiarizing his teachings from Plato. Celsus had warned that Christianity itself was drawing people away from traditional religion and claimed that its growth would lead to a collapse of traditional, conservative values. -...";['Origen of Alexandria'];2021-12-09T00:00:00Z;['eng'];43678;752747581;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'christian', 'church history', 'christian history', 'early church', 'early church father'];audio;https://archive.org/details/against_celsus_bk4_2112_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, christian, church history, christian history, early church, early church father;2021-12-09;2;43678;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/against_celsus_bk4_2112_librivox/AgainstCelsus4_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (119MB)'}]

Milne, is best known – perhaps to most people only known – for his children’s book, Winnie the Pooh. Yet he was an incredibly prolific author. He published dozens of successful plays, myriad humorous articles written for internationally prominent journals, a wide range of social, political, and other nonfiction works, and even a murder mystery. This collection is humorous throughout, but humorous in a particularly Milnesque way: he consciously and quite openly rejected the bitterness of satire in favor of a peculiarly gentle, often self-deprecating humor. Included here are dozens of short essays showing, among other things, Milne’s extraordinary capacity to understand – and be understood by – children, and his special affinity for women, as friends and as lovers. - Summary by Kirsten Wever For further information, including links to online text,...;['A.

At that time Catholics were banned from attending the ancient British universities. The issue was particularly acute in Ireland with its majority Catholic population, so the British government decided to found some non-denominational colleges there which would admit all but which also were not allowed to have Catholic theology faculties in them. The pope of that time, Pius IX, urged the Irish bishops instead to found a Catholic university. Newman, as the leading intellectual Catholic convert, was appointed its founding Rector. He gave a series of public lectures, arguing the case for a Catholic university (such as existed elsewhere in Europe) and also that a university should include theology among its subjects.

Taboo and the Perils of the Soul by James Frazer. Read in English by Leon Harvey The third volume of The Golden Bough. The term Taboo is one of the very few words which the English language has borrowed from the speech of savages. This volume examines the underlying moral code of many societies, both primitive and medieval, and with modern analogies. The reader is encouraged to contemplate the contradictions, inconsistencies, and absurdities, not merely between different people of different countries and ages, but also between similar people within the same countries.

566;murder_of_delicia_2104_librivox;The Murder of Delicia;"LibriVox recording of The Murder of Delicia by Marie Corelli. Read in English by Angelique G. Campbell. Introduction Read by shelleturner; The following slight and unelaborated sketch of a very commonplace and everyday tragedy will, I am aware, meet with the unqualified disapproval of the 'superior' sex. They will assert, with much indignant emphasis, that the character of 'Lord Carlyon' is an impossible one, and that such a 'cad' as he is shown to be never existed. Anticipating these remarks, I have to say in reply that the two chief personages in my story, namely, 'Lord Carlyon' and his wife, are drawn strictly from the life; and, that though both the originals have some years since departed from this scene of earthly contest and misunderstanding, so that my delineation of their characters can no longer grieve or offend either, the 'murder of Delicia' was consummated at the hands of her husband precisely in the way I have depicted it. - Summary by Marie Corelli For further...";['Marie Corelli'];2021-04-13T00:00:00Z;['eng'];39168;1060738256;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'marriage', 'feminism', 'author', 'equality'];audio;https://archive.org/details/murder_of_delicia_2104_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, marriage, feminism, author, equality;2021-04-13;;39168;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/murder_of_delicia_2104_librivox/MurderDelicia_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (173MB)'}]

In 1903, Panama became a brand new state in Central America by seceding from Colombia in order to facilitate the construction of the Panama Canal, which was finished in 1914. This fledgling nation was home to the oldest inhabited European settlement on the American continent, a rich indigenous culture, and a splendid natural beauty from coast to jungle. Such was the scene as found by George A. Miller as he was ""Prowling about Panama"" in 1919, an activity that is more a ""getting lost in the right way"" than systematic exploration. Follow the author on his prowls through an amazing country that at the time of writing was an exciting mixture of tradition and modernity. (Summary by Ava).

572;crock_of_gold_2103_librivox;The Crock of Gold;LibriVox recording of The Crock of Gold by James Stephens. Read in English by Michele Fry This is a comic novel written by Irish author James Stephens, a quick-witted storyteller whose pantheistic philosophy is revealed in his adult Irish fairy tales. His first novel, The Charwoman's Daughter (1911), humorously examines the life and fantasies of a poor Dublin mother and daughter. His second, The Crock of Gold (1913), again showcases his unique writing style, quirky thoughts, grasp of irony and cleverness of phrase. No conformity here, lots of head-scratching twists and turns that reveal odd bits of wisdom too! The main characters are an extremely pedantic Philosopher, his revengeful wife, their sweet innocent children lured down leprechaun holes, a teenage girl seduced by Pan (the god of lust and carefree living) then saved by Angus Og (the Irish god of youth, love and beauty), culminating in a giant parade of Irish gods.

Read in English by Carol Pelster In 1841 and 1842, Fr. Pierre-Jean DeSmet traversed the wide and wild American West to bring the gospel to the Flatheads, who had sent multiple delegations from Montana to St. Louis, repeatedly requesting a Blackgown priest to instruct them in Christianity. Fr. DeSmet’s letters to his Jesuit Superiors show his heroic religious dedication and selflessness, as he recounts fatigues, hunger, thirst, and dangers that rival those of the apostle St. Paul. He also makes intelligent observations of geography, geology, weather (including an enthusiastic description of a tornado), and the interesting customs of the different tribes he meets. His generous love and respect for the Indians was rewarded by their receptivity to his gospel message, with thousands receiving baptism. In years subsequent to the writing of these letters, Fr.

Jim, an orphan, is sent to live with relatives along the Devon coast. There he accidentally witnesses the deeds of a troop of night-riders, or smugglers, and becomes caught up in their shadowy, dangerous world of excise men, sea caves and illicit cargo. The adventure takes the boy to sea against his will, where he faces hurdle after hurdle. From a skirmish with a British frigate to a nightmarish chase on horseback to run-ins with soldiers and gypsies, the plot stays rip-roaring, and the atmospheric prose supplies a polished, literary veneer.

Read in English by VioletBleu Mary Platt Parmele brings to life the history of Germany and it's rise to prominence in Europe. From scheming nobles to treaties created under the guise of peace, the reader is transported to the years before a cohesive group of city-states that became Germany. She shows us how the power of the Catholic church stoked the fires of revolution, and caused the great schism between the Catholic people and the newly forming Protestant sects. The book begins by discussing the origins of the Aryan race (framed as describing people of Indo-European heritage as a racial grouping, or distinctive race/sub-race of the Caucasians) and ends around 1871 when Germany was united after defeating Napoleon.

Seventeenth-century Puritan theologian John Bunyan wrote The Life and Death of Mr. Badman as a companion piece to The Pilgrim’s Progress, the literary work for which Bunyan is best remembered. Although both works are Christian allegories that provide the reader with moral and spiritual instruction, The Pilgrim’s Progress accomplishes this goal primarily via the positive example of the protagonist, while The Life and Death of Mr. Badman does the opposite; Pilgrim is ultimately destined for heaven, while Mr. Badman is destined for hell. The two works also differ in their format. Pilgrim’s story is presented as a dream sequence, while Mr. Badman’s story is instead told via a dialogue between two other characters: Mr. Wiseman, who relates Mr. Badman’s narrative and draws life lessons from it, and Mr. Attentive, who asks prompting questions and makes comments on the tale he hears.

Read in English by MichaelMaggs The Book of Common Prayer (BCP) has for nearly 500 years provided the basis for Anglican and allied worship, not only in its English home but many countries around the world. Following England's break from Rome in 1534, a need was felt for a single order of worship - in English rather than the traditional Latin - to be used in churches throughout the country. BCP first appeared in 1549 during the reign of Edward VI, was abolished under Mary (who restored Roman Catholicism) and was re-introduced with modifications by Elizabeth I in 1559. During the English Civil War (1642–1651) it was again abolished, returning with a 1662 revision under James I. In its 1662 incarnation, BCP remained largely unchanged as the sole legal basis for Anglican worship in England right up until the 1970s (though in 1859 some of the more anti-Catholic elements such as the Gunpowder...;['The Parliament of England'];2021-04-01T00:00:00Z;['eng'];54732;736501886;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'bcp', '1662', 'common prayer', 'have hold', 'better worse', 'richer poorer', 'speak now', 'foreever hold', 'your peace', 'ashes dust', 'death part'];audio;https://archive.org/details/commmon_prayer_1662_2104_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, bcp, 1662, common prayer, have hold, better worse, richer poorer, speak now, foreever hold, your peace, ashes dust, death part;2021-04-01;6;54732;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/commmon_prayer_1662_2104_librivox/BookCommonPrayer_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (116MB)'}]

When we consider the mental darkness which enveloped the world in the days of Luther and Calvin, under Popish superstition and idolatry, and that theirs were some of the first attempts to emancipate the human intellect from more than ""Egyptian darkness,"" the reader will undoubtedly censure lightly any defects that may appear in their discourses; considering their great object to have been, the removal of that servile yoke of papistry under which nations were groaning, and of bringing mankind into the liberty of the gospel.

Read in English by George Emerson A poem by the Latin poet Virgil, the second of his three known works. ""Georgic"" means ""to work the land,"" and on such matters of labour Virgil dwells and celebrates. In a dramatic survey of practices including agriculture, viticulture, animal husbandry, and bee-keeping, as well as the themes and mythos of labour, pastoral life, the glory of Roman citizenship, and the chaos that disrupts the fruitfulness of our daily lives, Virgil weaves a lyrical tapestry of both Greek and Roman thread portraying the complex relationship between humanity and the divine.

In this prequel to both ""An Outcast of the Islands"" and ""Almayer's Folly"", Tom Lingard, after several years of expensive preparation, is right on the verge of pulling off a noble plan to restore a tribal prince and princess to their rightful realm with the help of native allies through a show of force when he learns that a wealthy and arrogant Englishman has accidentally run his pleasure yacht aground right in the middle of his own proposed field of operations.

Charles; Julian Pratley Since the publication of this book, a little more than a year ago, the interest in Einstein and the principle of relativity has very greatly increased. There are now a large number of popular expositions, and the theory itself has undergone some notable advances in its philosophical, mathematical and physical application. In pure philosophy Lord Haldane's Reign of Relativity has applied it to the direct interpretation of the theory of knowledge. In mathematical physics the important work of Hermann Weyl, Space-Time-Matter, is an advance even on Einstein, and applies the principle not only to the geometry of masses, but to that of intermolecular movements, and to electro-magnetic phenomena generally, thus making it embrace the physical world in its entirety.

The work became a model for all later encyclopedias in terms of the breadth of subject matter examined, the need to reference original authors, and a comprehensive index list of the contents.

On a visit to Portsmouth, he saw a picture of John Pounds and felt inspired and humbled by the crippled cobbler's work. Pounds had been injured in a shipbuilding accident at the age of 15. He later became a shoemaker and, in 1818, he began teaching poor children without charging fees. He actively recruited children and young people to his school, spending time on the streets and quays making contact and even bribing them to come with the offer of baked potatoes. He began teaching local children reading, writing, and arithmetic. He also gave lessons in cooking, carpentry and shoe making until his death in 1839.

She conquers Oxford society and sets many hearts aflame, among them that of Douglas Falloden, a conceited aristocrat at the university. However, his assumption that she will fall at his feet comes to nothing. Later, some ragging by ‘bloods’, led by Falloden, of a Polish musician at his college (Radowitz) leads to a bad injury.

Excerpt from Introduction: ""Nana"" stands third in popularity among the Zola novels. It is a study of the prostitute type and it gives a memorable picture of the life of the tinsel underworld of the Paris theaters, night life, and its parasites. Perhaps Zola pursues Nana a bit too relentlessly: certainly his putting a period to her career by showing her as a putrefying corpse is more symbolic than is wholly necessary; but it remains a novel of truth and beauty, even if a beauty of a drab and often terrible sort.

This education originates with Rousseau. With much reluctance I have been obliged to dwell, at considerable length, on the facts of his life, in order to show that his glittering structure rests, not upon any broad and firm foundation of well-generalized and well-sifted experience, but upon the private tastes and preferences of an exceptionally capricious and self-centered nature. His Emile is simply his selfish and unsocial self, forcibly withheld, by an external Providence, in the shape of an impossible tutor, from those aberrations which led that self into the a ""dark forest "" of misery.

Read in English by Pamela Nagami During the last half of the second century B.C. Rome was undisputed mistress of the civilized western world. As the British historian, Augustus Henry Beesly writes, ""a brilliant period of foreign conquest had succeeded the 300 years in which she had overcome her neighbors and made herself supreme in Italy. In 146 B.C. she had given the death-blow to her greatest rival, Carthage, and had annexed Greece."" But Rome was on the brink of a one hundred year-long revolution. In this slim volume Beesley, recounts the careers of four of its first dynamic leaders: the idealistic Brothers Gracchi, who attempted land reforms, and the rough, resourceful soldier, Marius, who overhauled the army. The book closes with ruthless, charismatic Sulla who, gaining the allegiance of the Roman legions, in 82 B.C. seized the capitol and after a vengeful purge, tried by reactionary measures to turn back the...";['A.

Weltkrieg als unbedeutender Leutnant und findet Arbeit als Hauslehrer beim reichen Juden Efrussi. Dort lernt er Dr. Trebitsch kennen, der ihn in die Münchner Geheimorganisation S II einführt. Theodor arbeitet zunächst als kleiner Spitzel in Berlin; als er aber bei einer passenden Gelegenheit seinen Vorgesetzten ermordet, übernimmt er dessen Posten.

Read in English by Pamela Nagami. At its height, the British Empire was the largest in history. This short volume traces its development through the long 18th century, from 1714 to the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Founded on the prosperity of Sir Robert Walpole's ministry (1721-1742), the Empire emerged from the Indian conquests of that gifted military amateur, Lord Clive, and was extended under the leadership of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, who drove the English to victory in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). Surmounting the loss of the American colonies and twenty years of conflict with France, by the first quarter of the 19th century, the British navy, master of the oceans, presided over an Empire upon which the sun never set.

678;we_2101_librivox;We;LibriVox recording of We by Yevgeny Zamyatin. (Translated by Gregory Zilboorg.) Read in English by mleigh We is considered to be one of the first dystopian novels and the inspiration for later novels in the genre such as George Orwell's 1984 and Aldus Huxley's Brave New World . The story takes place in a future totalitarian world where conformity is good and individuality bad. It is written from the perspective of one of the members of this society who sees all he knows and loves falling apart due to others' quest for freedom of thought and action. This book addresses the perpetual conflict between between independent individualism and mob mentality. This work, by Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin has the distinction of being the first book banned by the Soviet Union.

Read in English by David Wales “The Christmas Tales Of Flanders presented in this volume are popular fables and legends current in Flanders and Brabant, which have for centuries been told to children throughout Belgium. Their origin is doubtful, as all literature handed down by oral tradition must be. A good many of these stories are found in a different guise in the legends of other nations…. These tales occupy for the Flemish the place nursery rhymes take in England…” (Introduction) The book title may be a bit misleading as the stories, with two exceptions, do not concern themselves with Christmas. Perhaps a way to think about this is that they are good stories to tell around a roaring yule fire. - Summary by Book Introduction and David Wales For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to...;['Andre de Ridder'];2021-03-28T00:00:00Z;['eng'];23966;444124926;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'fairy tales', 'Christmas', 'folk tales', 'stories', 'Belgium', 'holidays', 'brabant'];audio;https://archive.org/details/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, fairy tales, Christmas, folk tales, stories, Belgium, holidays, brabant;2021-03-28;3;23966;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/christmas_tales_of_flanders_2103_librivox/ChristmasTalesFlanders_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (72.9MB)'}]

Read in English by InTheDesert Of all commentators I believe John Calvin to be the most candid...He was no trimmer and pruner of texts. He gave their meaning as far as he knew it. His honest intention was to translate the Hebrew and the Greek originals as accurately as he possibly could, and then to give the meaning which would naturally be conveyed by such Greek and Hebrew words: he laboured, in fact, to declare, not his own mind upon the Spirit's words, but the mind of the Spirit as couched in those words. Dr. King very truly says of him, ""No writer ever dealt more fairly and honestly by the Word of God. He is scrupulously careful to let it speak for itself, and to guard against every tendency of his own mind to put upon it a questionable meaning for the sake of establishing some doctrine which he feels to be important, or some theory which he is anxious to uphold.

In her description of the plague (much detail taken from the diarist, Pepys), followed by The Great Fire, Manning is taken out of her comfort zone to the sordid realities.

The second novel in the Parade's End tetralogy, No More Parades places army captain (and former civil servant and statistician) Christopher Tietjens, his beautiful but cruel wife Sylvia, and Tietjens' jealous and tempestuous godfather and commanding officer General Campion in, and just behind, the lines at Rouen, France in 1917, where Christopher finds himself subject not only to physical, but also to mental and moral torments that speak volumes about the society of which he is a part, and which will perhaps surprise many a modern reader/listener. - Summary by Peter Dann For further information, including links to...";['Ford Madox Ford'];2021-06-05T00:00:00Z;['eng'];29247;1446430563;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'World War 1', 'western front', 'Great War', 'rouen'];audio;https://archive.org/details/no_more_parades_2106_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, World War 1, western front, Great War, rouen;2021-06-05;2;29247;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/no_more_parades_2106_librivox/NoMoreParades_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (233MB)'}]

Read in English by Aaron Bennett The three-month-long battle of Okinawa covered a 700-mile arc from Formosa to Kyushu and involved a million combatants--Americans, Japanese, British, and native Okinawans. With a magnitude that rivaled the Normandy invasion the previous June, the battle of Okinawa was the biggest and costliest single operation of the Pacific War. For each of its 82 days of combat, the battle would claim an average of 3,000 lives from the antagonists and the unfortunate non-combatants.” (Joseph H.

Did the narrator merely say that they happened, without saying how they happened, they could easily be classified with the cow who jumped over the moon or the more introspective individual who jumped down his own throat. In short, they are all tall stories; and though tall stories may also be true stories, there is something in the very phrase appropriate to such a topsy-turvydom; for the logician will presumably class a tall story with a corpulent epigram or a long-legged essay.

The Apostolic Constitutions are made up of eight treatises on Early Christian discipline, worship, and doctrine, which was intended to act as a manual of guidance for the clergy, and laity. It claims to be composed by the Twelve Apostles who received these instructions from Jesus Christ, although most scholars believe it to be a 4th-century work. The structure of the work is as follows: Books 1 to 6 are a re-writing of the Didascalia Apostolorum. Book 7 is based largely on the Didache, with Chapters 33-45 containing prayers similar to existing Jewish ones. Book 8 has a treatise on charismata, along with, what are known as, the Canons of the Apostles.

732;commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox;Commentary on Romans;"LibriVox recording of Commentary on Romans by Theodoret of Cyrus. Read in English by InTheDesert Theodoret was born at Antioch, A.D. 386. His studies were pursued under Theodore of Mopsuista and Chrysostom, from the works of the latter of whom the present commentary is by many esteemed little more than an abridgement. This, however, on comparing the writings of both those Fathers, can hardly perhaps be admitted in its fullest sense. ""Of all the Fathers, who have composed works of different kinds, Theodoret is one of those who has been very happy in every one of them. There are some who have been excellent writers in matters of controversy, but bad interpreters. Others have been good historians, but bad divines. Some have good success in morality, who have no skill in doctrinal points. And very rare is it for those who have addicted themselves to works of piety to be good critics. Theodoret had all these qualities, and it may be said, that he has equally deserved the name of a good...";['Theodoret of Cyrus'];2021-08-31T00:00:00Z;['eng'];16577;775744932;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'Bible', 'Romans', 'commentary', 'patristics'];audio;https://archive.org/details/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, Bible, Romans, commentary, patristics;2021-08-31;2;16531;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/commentary_on_romans_2108_librivox/CommentaryRomans_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (120MB)'}]

734;gods_and_mr_perrin_2112_librivox;The Gods and Mr Perrin;LibriVox recording of The Gods and Mr Perrin by Hugh Walpole. Read in English by Simon Evers The book is probably better known under the title ‘Mr Perrin and Mr Traill’, later made into a well-known film in 1948. Perrin and Traill are masters at a grim old-fashioned second-rate boarding public school in Cornwall – Perrin has been there many years and the youthful Traill has just arrived. The book concerns the growing antagonism between the two which turns into active dislike following an unfortunate incident and which eventually has devastating consequences. The author vividly captures the dreadful nature of such a cloistered society and the stultifying effect it has on the pupils, their teachers and the other adults in the community. - Summary by Simon Evers For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

736;inthewilderness_2105_librivox;In the Wilderness;LibriVox recording of In the Wilderness by Charles Dudley Warner. Read in English by Zach Hoyt These eight essays about Charles Dudley Warner’s visit to the Adirondacks cover a broad range of topics, all with more or less of his dry humor. They include spoofs of the popular Adirondack ‘sportsman’ stories being published at the time, a plea for hunting regulations told from the viewpoint of a deer, the biography of a local guide and character, and reflections on humanity’s effect on the wilderness and vice versa. Much has changed in the Adirondacks since the 1870s, but getting lost in the woods is still pretty much the same now as it seems to have been then.

And the plot primarily follows the struggles and triumphs of two couples, the two brothers Moore, Louis and Robert, and Caroline Helstone and Shirley Keeldar. The final scenes capture the essence of the change in this world, and one hopes for the more philanthropic and egalitarian world pictured there, but at the same time one laments the loss of a world of magic and of a respect for natural beauty. - Summary by Jim Locke For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to...";['Charlotte Brontë'];2021-01-15T00:00:00Z;['eng'];34022;3709646837;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'romance', 'novel'];audio;https://archive.org/details/shirley_version2_2101_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, romance, novel;2021-01-15;;33983;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/shirley_version2_2101_librivox/Shirley201-18_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 01-18 (328MB)'}, {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/shirley_version2_2101_librivox/Shirley219-37_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 19-37 (296MB)'}]

James Mars was born in Connecticut in 1790 and spent the better part of his youth a slave working for various owners—once fleeing to the woods with his family to avoid being relocated to the South. At age twenty-five he became a free man and moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where he became a leader in the local African American community. His memoir is one of the more famous accounts of slave life in early New England. 2) Facts for the People of the Free States, by American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, published about 1846.

This work was entirely lost sight of: no one seems ever to have quoted a word of it. But it has quite recently reappeared in an Armenian manuscript together with Books IV and V of the greater work. The Armenian translation proves to be a fairly close rendering of the original Greek… What Irenaeus undertakes in the present work is to set out the main points of this Apostolic message, which, as he has explained in his greater work, has been handed down in the Church by the successions of the bishops and is the same in substance in all parts of the world, and to demonstrate its truth more especially from the sacred scriptures of the Old Testament. - Summary from Preface...;['Irenaeus'];2021-10-19T00:00:00Z;['eng'];21733;296876543;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'bible', 'old testament', 'christian', 'prophecy', 'theology', 'apologetics', 'Church Fathers', 'recapitulation'];audio;https://archive.org/details/demonstration_apostolic_preaching_2110_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, bible, old testament, christian, prophecy, theology, apologetics, Church Fathers, recapitulation;2021-10-19;4;21733;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/demonstration_apostolic_preaching_2110_librivox/DemonstrationApolosticPreaching_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (46MB)'}]

Their quest for love leads them to many different places. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about it: ""the novel persuaded certain moralistic people that a woman could be seduced without being immoral"". It was scandalous for the time because of the frank descriptions of sexuality and relationships. Yet to the modern readers it may seem as if someone wrote this book only a few years ago. The author was a well respected journalist and novelist. This book was so ""risky"" for him that he published it under a pen name. It is recommended to those who wish to learn about the Jazz age, about the new woman (as she is seen by a man) and about a discourse which was completely new at the time.

The church was an important force, and those adhering to traditional eastern religions were peaceful and accustomed to 'doing as they were told'; followers of western thought were more eager for a democratic society.

The author is a coloured young man, born and reared in the city of Philadelphia. This city, standing as it does on the frontier between free and slave territory, has accumulated naturally a large population of the mixed and African race. Being one of the nearest free cities of any considerable size to the slave territory, it has naturally been a resort of escaping fugitives, or of emancipated slaves. In this city they form a large class — have increased in numbers, wealth, and standing — they constitute a peculiar society of their own, presenting many social peculiarities worthy of interest and attention.

Some of the myths and legends are interesting or amusing because flowers, insects, or birds are presented as personalities and emphasise human qualities or feelings. Some of the stories and poems contribute to the child’s store of knowledge by attracting his attention to some fact, beauty, or blessing in nature which may have escaped his notice. Still others make an appeal by suggesting or affirming the abiding hope symbolised in the thought, “See the land her Easter keeping.” The child’s heart is filled with the joy of spring,—with the rapture expressed in the thrush’s song which Mrs. Ewing describes. “Fresh water and green woods, ambrosial sunshine and sun-flecked shade, chattering brooks and rustling leaves, glade...;['Various'];2021-06-24T00:00:00Z;['eng'];44210;1165312693;['librivox', 'audiobooks'];audio;https://archive.org/details/emeraldstorybook_2106_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, ;2021-06-24;4;44210;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/emeraldstorybook_2106_librivox/EmeraldStoryBook_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (193MB)'}]

803;nomansland_2112_librivox;No Man's Land;LibriVox recording of No Man's Land by Sapper.   Read in English by afinevoice. This book was written by a British Army officer and decorated Western Front veteran. Soldiers could not publish books using their real names, so newspaper magnate Lord Northcliffe christened McNeile, Sapper, to reflect his Royal Engineers background, under which pseudonym the book was published. McNeile also wrote the Bulldog Drummond spy/wartime adventures. No Man's Land is made up of five parts: The Way To The Land is a preface to the rest of the book in which fictional character Clive Draycott travels in Europe prior to the outbreak of the war. Part II The Land consists of 8 stories detailing the day to day lives of soldiers in the trenches. Part III Seed Time is about a salesman turned soldier, and Part IV Harvest in which Sapper puts forward the theory that war is awful, and many suffer but those who survive it can be changed for the better. Themes of class, gender, history abound. - Summary by...;['Sapper'];2021-12-27T00:00:00Z;['eng'];26334;1312013824;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'fiction', 'World War I', 'WWI'];audio;https://archive.org/details/nomansland_2112_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, fiction, World War I, WWI;2021-12-27;4;26334;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/nomansland_2112_librivox/NoMansLand_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (213MB)'}]

The chapter on Prayer, marked by absence of psychological speculation, treats practically of the naturalness and good sense of the constant habit of prayer, and of the value of prayer in all psychoneurosis....The chapter on the Bible and Health is of especial interest, with its argument that the sanitary laws of the Jews could have been no outcome of human development, but rather of Divine origin....The wide reading, extended experience, and specialized scholarship of the writer certify to the value of anything from his pen, and when we find a work of this kind as simple as a primer and as attractive as a story, we may well offer thanks for the boon.

Read in English by Phil Chenevert Published in 1879, this play was a bombshell, exposing the tragic hypocrisy of Victorian middle class marriage. The play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman, who at the time in Norway lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male-dominated world. - A wife was almost literally a bird in a cage for display by the husband. Note that this is a solo reading of the entire play by one person. We have an excellent dramatic reading of this play in our catalog also if a more traditional performance is more to your taste.)

From the preface: ""The main purpose of our existence on earth—aside from the sacred and paramount duty of securing our salvation—is undoubtedly to make ourselves masters of the tangible world around us, as it stands revealed to our senses, and as it was expressly made subject to our will by the Creator. We are, however, at the same time, not left without information about the existence of certain laws and the occurrence of certain phenomena, which belong to a world not...";['Maximilian Schele De Vere'];2021-10-29T00:00:00Z;['eng'];16835;2591133459;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'magic', 'superstition', 'Occult', 'witchcraft'];audio;https://archive.org/details/modern_magic_2110_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, magic, superstition, Occult, witchcraft;2021-10-29;15;16835;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/modern_magic_2110_librivox/ModernMagic00-14_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 00-14 (319MB)'}, {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/modern_magic_2110_librivox/ModernMagic15-22_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook 15-22 (98MB)'}]

Read in English by Pamela Nagami This little book opens on the eve of the French Revolution. The government is crippled by financial mismanagement, ruled by a King who, in the author's words, is ""devoid of both ability and energy,"" and resented by a tax-oppressed peasantry and a rising middle class. The Revolution escapes the control of its instigators and France is plunged into the Terror and international war. Enter Napoleon, a man with ""an enormous capacity for work,"" who can ""get to the root of a matter and master technicalities with great swiftness,"" but whose ""vulgar desire for recognition...and his inability to feel the sufferings of others"" ultimately leads to his country's downfall. Davis then presents the careers of Napoleon's successors, including his nephew, Louis Napoleon who, scarcely better than an inept imposter, plunges France in 1870 into the disastrous Franco-Prussian War.

Sylvester Graham, also known as the ""Father of Vegetarianism"", was a Presbyterian minister who emphasized clean eating. Graham endorsed the consumption of unprocessed foods, as close in kind as possible to those consumed by our wild ancestors. Whole-grain bread was a favorite topic of his, and in this treatise he expounds upon the origins, benefits, and production of the healthiest bread possible. Graham's message about healthy living exploded in popularity after an 1832 cholera outbreak in New York City. On his lecture tour after the publication of A Treatise on Bread, and Bread-Making in 1837, he was thronged with admirers, although his lecture circuit was interrupted by angry butchers and commercial bakers. His ideas about the connection between food and physical and spiritual health inspired the Kelloggs, and the Graham cracker is named after him.

856;some_do_not_2105_librivox;Some Do Not...;"LibriVox recording of Some Do Not... by Ford Madox Ford. Read in English by Peter Dann Set immediately before and during the Great War, Some Do Not... is a tale of social cruelty among the English upper classes that pits real honour against shameless duplicity and subjects its principal characters to extremes of mental suffering that appear to be analogous to the (never directly described) physical horrors of the actual fighting. The plot revolves around the mores and desires of the intellectually brilliant but impossibly high-minded Christopher Tietjens, his icy wife Sylvia, and Valentine Wannop, a poor but well-educated young woman who loves Christopher, and is in many ways his moral and intellectual equal. In its time, the novel was unusual for its daring, often disorienting, use of flashbacks within scenes, for its scrambling together of interior and spoken dialog, and for the demand it places on the reader to interpret what is ""really"" taking place on the basis of slender and...";['Ford Madox Ford'];2021-05-23T00:00:00Z;['eng'];12799;2026258559;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'adultery', 'divorce', 'Great War', 'social climbing', 'shell shock', 'bluestocking'];audio;https://archive.org/details/some_do_not_2105_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, adultery, divorce, Great War, social climbing, shell shock, bluestocking;2021-05-23;2;12799;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/some_do_not_2105_librivox/SomeDoNot_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (326MB)'}]

Read in English by Bruce Pirie “The Story of a Modern Woman” (1894) is a work of feminist social realism. In its time it was one of the most famous and influential novels to grow out of and shape the “New Woman” movement of the 1890s. It won such attention for its author that Ella Hepworth Dixon was given the nickname “The New Woman.” The story of the novel’s protagonist, Mary Erle, loosely follows the outline of Dixon’s own situation. As the well-educated daughter of a public intellectual, she enters the world of professional writing after his death, partly trading on his name. Victorian society had been distinctly patriarchal, and women were expected to find their places under the protection of men, traditionally defining themselves as wives and mothers. However, by the 1890s, an alarming “surplus” of unmarried women in Britain meant that many had statistically little chance of becoming anyone’s...;['Ella Hepworth Dixon'];2021-04-08T00:00:00Z;['eng'];22656;1243543411;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'feminism', 'bildungsroman', 'new woman', 'social realism', '1890s', 'condition of women'];audio;https://archive.org/details/story_of_a_modern_woman_ver2_2104_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, feminism, bildungsroman, new woman, social realism, 1890s, condition of women;2021-04-08;3;22656;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/story_of_a_modern_woman_ver2_2104_librivox/StoryModernWoman2_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (199.4MB)'}]

Read in English by InTheDesert While many of Calvin's sermons are now lost after they were sold by weight by the library of Geneva, his sermons on Ephesians have been preserved, having been translated into Early Modern English by Arthur Golding (who also translated Calvin's sermons on Galatians, Job and Deuteronomy).

911;womanofgenius_2108_librivox;A Woman of Genius;"LibriVox recording of A Woman of Genius by Mary Hunter Austin. Read in English by Amy Dunkleberger In this 1912 novel, Mary Hunter Austin (1868-1934) draws inspiration from her own life to tell the story of a gifted woman caught between her public ambition and her private desire. Beginning with her post-Civil War Midwestern girlhood, Austin chronicles the tumultuous life -- its romantic and artistic challenges -- of ""tragic actress"" Olivia Lattimore. With lyrical insight, she explores the many social and economic obstacles talented women like Olivia face in their pursuit of self-fulfillment. In America’s cynical Gilded Age, Austin asks, can a “woman of genius” find both happiness and success?

No one had ever been able to catch him; not even Precious Sue, a bluetick hound peerless in tracking down coons. But Harky felt that this autumn the hunting would be different. Old Joe was in for trouble. Precious Sue had a pup who looked like a natural-born coon hunter. With his web-footed paws he was as skillful in the water as any coon. And on land, Duckfoot had a nose that beat every other hound hollow. Harky had a few troubles of his own. First there was school. Miss Cathby was nice, but she was a teacher. She called Old Joe a raccoon. And she said he could not live forever because he was mortal. Then there were girls. More specifically, there was Melinda—the bossiest, uppitiest young lady for miles around. And she wanted to hunt.

928;in_old_plantation_days_2105_librivox;In Old Plantation Days;LibriVox recording of In Old Plantation Days by Paul Laurence Dunbar. Read in English by Jim Locke. With this collection of short stories, Dunbar sought to draw on the success of his dialect poems by recreating and portraying the southern plantation during slavery. The stories focus on the stereotypical portrait of slaves as obedient workers happy to spend their lives in service of their benevolent owner. His attempt to find success was only partially realized, as his stories drew not only criticism but, in some cases, anger at their very stereotypical nature.

Read by Celine Major (Excerpt) One aspect of this subject of revolutionary women, their connection with the secret societies of the day I have purposely ignored. It is obscure and highly controversial. Unfortunately, though these societies have been much, written about, and especially of late, it has often been in a partisan spirit. This book will constantly deal with parties, but I trust not in the spirit of a partisan. Of the three methods of treating this subject, the strictly chronological method, the biographical, and a classification according to the play of ideas and the modes and fields of action, I have chosen the last. Though it has its drawbacks, one of which is some slight repetition, it seems to me that this method gives the clearest impression of the movement as a whole, and of the part women played in it. - Summary by Celine Major For further information, including links to online text,...;['Winifred Stephens Whale'];2021-06-30T00:00:00Z;['eng'];16076;1312967159;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'french revolution', 'women revolutionaries'];audio;https://archive.org/details/womenoffrenchrevolution_2106_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, french revolution, women revolutionaries;2021-06-30;;16076;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/womenoffrenchrevolution_2106_librivox/WomenFrenchRevolution_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (241MB)'}]

A good companion, "" a fellow of infinite jest,"" life to him was a gallant spectacle, which he loved to look at and did not take seriously. Worldly success never tempted him, for he was a Bohemian by birth; but he was also descendant of a bardic sept, and he wanted to be a poet. So he wrote verses charged with the melancholy regret of the Celt for vanished glories and the beauty of remote things, dainty opalescent lyrics with hints of fairy music, witty and ironic verse on passing events, and, occasionally, prose sketches.

Ralph Delahaye Paine (August 28, 1871 – April 29, 1925) was an American journalist and author popular in the early 20th century. Paine's book tells of pirates, heroes, scoundrels, and treasure seekers creating, stealing, seeking, and sometimes finding great wealth. It also tells of treasures yet undiscovered (as of 1911, but perhaps to this day). It remains the stuff of dreams for countless kids growing up, and those of us who never grew up. - Summary by Tony Posante For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

Read in English by Owlivia; Trenton; Minnie; Rita Boutros; Michele Eaton; Mario Pineda; Jim Locke; Craig Campbell; Kazbek; Wayne Cooke This shorter book on Erasmus might be considered a companion to Huizinga's most famous work, The Waning of the Middle Ages. While in his magnum opus he presented a study of the forms of life and thought in France and the Netherlands in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, in this one the subject is the central intellectual figure of the next generation after the period which Huizinga called the waning, or rather the autumn, of the Middle Ages. It was first published in 1924, and so belongs to the same period of the author. Erasmus was, as it appears from many of pages, a man for whom Huizinga had a very special sympathy. - Summary by Leni For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or...";['Johan Huizinga'];2021-03-10T00:00:00Z;['eng'];16367;1312465337;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'renaissance', 'Reformation'];audio;https://archive.org/details/erasmus_and_the_age_of_reformation_2103_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, renaissance, Reformation;2021-03-10;3;16367;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/erasmus_and_the_age_of_reformation_2103_librivox/Erasmus_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (216MB)'}]

In science we accept our subject-matter as it is presented in unanalysed experience; in philosophy we examine the first principles and ultimate questions that concern conscious experience itself. The problem of truth is a problem of philosophy. It is not a problem of merely historical interest, but a present problem—a living controversy, the issue of which is undecided. Its present interest may be said to centre round the doctrine of pragmatism, which some fifteen years ago began to challenge the generally accepted principles of philosophy. In expounding this problem of truth, my main purpose has been to make clear to the reader the nature of a problem of philosophy and to disclose the secret of its interest.

Edison took the knowledge gained from these subjects and combined it with an insatiable curiosity, a fascination with all aspects of technology, an indomitable spirit and a passion to overcome any problem or seize any opportunity that circumstance might present him with to eventually become one of the finest inventors the world has ever seen. This book explores some of the highs and lows that Edison encountered throughout his life and shows how he was able to turn apparent adverse situations to his advantage.

In court, in cottage, by princes and by humble folk, everywhere, by every one the minstrels were greeted with delight. To such sweet music did they sing the songs or ballads which they made or perchance had heard, to such sweet music, that those who listened could forget nor tale nor tune.

Read in English by TND Published in 1907 by Arthur Henry Patterson, a self-taught local naturalist, Wild Life on a Norfolk Estuary was one of his defining books on the seasonal nature and natural history of the Norfolk Broads. The book is presented in two sections - The first part documents life on and around Breydon Water and the Broads throughout each season of the year, whilst the second part is a continuation of a previous AHP book – Notes of an East Coast Naturalist.

One of these in particular was Mary Du Caurroy Russell, Duchess of Bedford (to whom this book is dedicated), who was herself a keen ornithologist.

It was subsequently published privately and circulated among his inner circle.

Where I have been obliged to use technical anatomical and physiological terms I have either explained their meaning in the text, aided by diagrams and figures, or I have given in brackets the English equivalents of the terms used.

It distinguishes between megatrends, those factors that will likely occur under any scenario, and game-changers, critical variables whose trajectories are far less certain. As the diversity and complexity of various factors has grown, there is increased attention to scenarios or alternative worlds.

1028;untempered_wind_2102_librivox;The Untempered Wind;LibriVox recording of The Untempered Wind by Joanna E. Wood. Read in English by Bruce Pirie Upon publication of “The Untempered Wind” in 1894, Joanna Wood quickly rose to international prominence, becoming in the next few years the most highly paid fiction-writer in Canada. In this novel, we find a detailed picture of village life. The narrative weaves through a variety of character types: the refined and the coarse, the humble and the self-righteous, the virtuous and the vicious. All these types are measured according to their treatment of Myron Holder, a young unwed mother — a “fallen woman” in the eyes of this “spiteful, narrow-minded village.” An early reviewer extolled Wood as Canada’s Charlotte Brontë, because of her sympathetic treatment of a disadvantaged woman trying to forge an independent life. An even more apt comparison might be to Thomas Hardy: like Hardy's characters, Myron is buffeted by cruel, relentless Fate — the “untempered wind” of the title. In “Silenced Sextet”...;['Joanna E.

St. Alphonsus considered him a miracle of obedience. Although weak in body, he did the work of three, and his great charity earned for him the title of Father of the Poor. He was a model of every virtue, and so drawn to Our Lord in the tabernacle that he had to do violence to himself to keep away. An angel in purity, he was accused of a shameful crime; but he bore the calumny with such patience that St. Alphonsus said: ""Brother Gerard is a saint"". He was favoured with infused knowledge of the highest order, ecstasies, prophecy, discernment of spirits, and penetration of hearts, bilocation, and with what seemed an unlimited power over nature, sickness, and the devils.

Mrs. Brennan, the local dressmaker, has opinions. Her son is off studying to become a priest, which elevates him -- and thus her -- in her opinion.

1059;gloryinthegrey_2103_librivox;The Glory in the Grey;"LibriVox recording of The Glory in the Grey by Archibald Alexander. Read in English by LibriVox Volunteers. It sometimes happens, when we are dispirited, that God's gracious gift of reviving comes to us along a very ordinary channel--in the form, perhaps, of some tonic, heartening passage found in reading, or the ""morning face"" and cheerful greeting of a friend. That is often all that we need--when our hurt is not serious-- to send us back with a new zest and courage to our tasks; and that is the sort of usefulness which is desired for this book. It does not pretend to deal with the great themes or the great hours of the religious life, but only with some of its simple encouragements and ideals for everyday. There is a wide difference between the far-off flash of guidance which the sailor steers by in the darkness, and the humbler lights on board which he sees to do his work. Yet he needs them both.

He commuted by horse-and-wagon or horse-and-sleigh each weekend, and seven of those long and challenging journeys are recorded in “Over Prairie Trails,” published in 1922. Grove has a sharp eye for details of nature that were of life-and-death importance to the lone prairie traveller — the shifting aspects of skies, wind, fog, and snow. On one level, the book is a treasury of documentary observation and nature writing. However, while Grove claims to offer a naturalist’s “plain truth,” we come to realize that he is creating a “tale” as much as a nature diary. He selects and arranges his material. Sometimes this means transforming his accounts into archetypal heroic journeys, casting himself as the Odyssean adventurer who...;['Frederick Philip Grove'];2021-10-04T00:00:00Z;['eng'];39320;1005147261;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'prairie', 'Canada', 'snow', 'winter', 'manitoba', 'fog', 'nature writing', 'memoirs', 'travel'];audio;https://archive.org/details/over_prairie_trails_2110_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, prairie, Canada, snow, winter, manitoba, fog, nature writing, memoirs, travel, ;2021-10-04;4;39320;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/over_prairie_trails_2110_librivox/OverPrairieTrails_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (161MB)'}]

He has the good sense to feel his insufficiency; and, aspiring to shine as an orator, engages a professor to teach him culture. Opposed to my lord, stands my lady, Dowlas; wife, a full-blown hollyhock of the aristocracy of Mammon. She affects to amend her spouse's cakelology, admits that an oath may now and then be suffered to garnish polite discourse, but then, it must be pronounced with an air to one's equals, and with a kind of careless condescension to menials. Pangloss is a peripatetic farce — an LL.D. and A.S.S. of Aberdeen.

I have read it through several times, and intend to read it again. It is one of the most humorous books I ever read.’ ‘That’s so,’ said Mark, ‘that’s so. Now, I will tell you something. I spent three months writing a satire on that book of Ward McAllister’s. And when I got through, I again read McAllister’s book, and then my satire, and then tore the blamed thing up.

A scathing attack against the Popes, Cardinals and Bishops living in luxury, who also refrain from teaching Scripture and would rather attach themselves to ""Doctors"" who often contradict themselves. Tyndale compares these men to the statements set forth in Scripture which teach that all men will be persecuted for their faith in Christ. He then shares his treatise on how Christians of all walks ought to conduct themselves, from servants to rulers, and all members of the household. It was for works like this that William Tyndale would eventually be executed by strangulation and as many of his works that were found were to be burned. - Summary by David Ronald For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS...";['William Tyndale'];2021-03-21T00:00:00Z;['eng'];18619;1352159916;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'Christianity', 'church history', 'Reformation', 'reformers'];audio;https://archive.org/details/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, Christianity, church history, Reformation, reformers;2021-03-21;1;18619;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/obedienceofchristianman_2103_librivox/ObiedienceChristianMan_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (220MB)'}]

Read in English by Danielle Cartwright; Jim Locke Woolf wrote this novel based on his experience as a government agent for British imperialist-controlled Ceylon in the early part of the twentieth-century. He focuses his story on one poor family in a jungle village as they struggle to survive, not just faced with a very harsh environment but with their own human prejudices, superstitions, jealousies, violence, ignorance, and greed. In the background is the other enemy: the foreign government that controls them but does not really understand or care for these uncivilized, not really human beings. It was an important work because its point of view was sympathetically a native one.

Therefore this series in its wide inclusiveness forms a more than ordinarily interesting history. The present study of the women of America is innocent of theorizing or philosophy and from the nature of the subject the narrative takes the reader into paths generally unfamiliar in historic studies. - From the Introduction by John A.

Read in English by Bruce Kachuk In his wonderful interpretation of the classic tale of Lamia - the mythological entity portrayed as being a deadly threat especially to children and young men - master poet John Keats construes this timeless and enigmatic story with a view towards intrigue, deception, loyalty, honor and fervor of a young man's lust for a life of passionate bliss with the newly found woman of his dreams. In retrospect, considering certain aspects of her past and recent serpent-like incarnation, the beautiful and seductive Lamia was a poor choice for the young man Lycius. But infatuation and the recklessness of youth superseded any rational thought and the wild attraction of the two lovers grew stronger. It would take his elderly mentor Apollonius (he ""robed in philosophic gown""), to alert Lycius to the hazards of this new relationship. However, whether Lycius will heed the warning of his ""trusty guide and good instructor"" seems...";['John Keats'];2021-08-07T00:00:00Z;['eng'];15682;128447809;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'poetry', 'philosophy', 'love', 'youth', 'wisdom', 'deception', 'loyalty', 'danger', 'infatuation', 'mentor'];audio;https://archive.org/details/lamia_2108_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, poetry, philosophy, love, youth, wisdom, deception, loyalty, danger, infatuation, mentor;2021-08-07;2;15682;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/lamia_2108_librivox/Lamia_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (20MB)'}]

He is famous for founding the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (the Redemptorists), and for his writings, which are among the most widely read in the Catholic world.

The preface to these sermons (written by St. Alphonsus): This work is entitled, ABRIDGED SERMONS FOR ALL THE SUNDAYS IN THE YEAR.

These are completely new stories but written in conformity with the way fairy tales are traditionally written and told. You will find ghosts and goblins; knaves and knights; widows and witches in them. But they all give the sense of wonder at the world that fairy tales have given us for ages past. - Summary by Phil Chenevert For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

(Translated by William Henry Fremantle.) Read in English by ancientchristian St. Jerome composed this essay against Helvidius, who stated that because the gospels mentioned Christ as having “sisters” and “brethren” the Virgin Mary must have had more children from Joseph her husband. In response Jerome asserts three propositions against Helvidius: 1) That Joseph was only putatively, not really, the husband of Mary. 2) That the “brethren” of the Lord were his cousins, not his own brethren. 3) That virginity is better than the married state. - Summary from the preface For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

(Translated by Nicholas Callan.) Read in English by ancientchristian. This work is entitled, ABRIDGED SERMONS FOR ALL THE SUNDAYS IN THE YEAR. They are called Abridged Sermons, because, although each contains abundant matter for a sermon, the sentiments are briefly expressed—not, however, so briefly as to render the sense obscure. Hence the work may be used for spiritual lectures. Diffuseness has been purposely avoided, that the preacher may extend the subject treated in the way which may appear best to him. A preacher will scarce ever deliver, with zeal and warmth, sentiments which he has not made in some manner his own. Hence the matter of each sermon has been condensed into a small compass, that the preacher may extend it according to his pleasure, and thus make it his own. In each sermon there are many passages from the Scriptures and Holy Fathers, and a variety of...;['Saint Alphonsus Liguori'];2021-05-15T00:00:00Z;['eng'];13541;1103685474;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'Catholic', 'christian', 'sermons', 'Italian', 'sunday sermons'];audio;https://archive.org/details/sermons1_2105_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, Catholic, christian, sermons, Italian, sunday sermons;2021-05-15;8;13541;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/sermons1_2105_librivox/SermonsLiguori_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (183MB)'}]

Robert Burns (25 January 1759 – 21 July 1796), also known familiarly as Rabbie Burns, the National Bard, Bard of Ayrshire, the Ploughman Poet and various other names and epithets,[nb 1] was a Scottish poet and lyricist.

Setting out with the simple goal of offering ""American households a mass of good reading"", the editors drew from literature of all times and all kinds what they considered the best pieces of human writing, and compiled an ambitious collection of 45 volumes (with a 46th being an index-guide). Besides the selection and translation of a huge number of poems, letters, short stories and sections of books, the collection offers, before each chapter, a short essay about the author or subject in question. In many cases, chapters contemplate not one author, but certain groups of works, organized by nationality, subject or period; there is, thus, a chapter on Accadian-Babylonian literature, one on the Holy Grail, and one on Chansons, for example.

Read by Bruce Pirie Published anonymously in 1894, “A Superfluous Woman” quickly became one of the most widely read of the “New Woman” novels that appeared at the end of the 19th century.

The only “medicine” she needs is a change of thinking and new self-awareness. Accordingly, the doctor coaches her to think more critically about her role as a woman and about the uses of meaningful labor. (Partly, this doctor is a spokesperson for the author: Emma Brooke was prominently engaged in feminist and socialist thought.)  Jessamine tries to radically re-invent herself by fleeing London (and a looming high-society marriage), to...;['Emma Francis Brooke'];2021-08-18T00:00:00Z;['eng'];20876;1880301901;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'socialism', 'feminism', 'the New Woman', 'bildungsroman', 'syphilis', '1890s', 'condition of women', 'sexually transmitted disease'];audio;https://archive.org/details/superfluouswoman_2108_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, socialism, feminism, the New Woman, bildungsroman, syphilis, 1890s, condition of women, sexually transmitted disease;2021-08-18;2;20876;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/superfluouswoman_2108_librivox/SuperfluousWoman_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (304MB)'}]

1213;londonassurance_2103_librivox;London Assurance;"LibriVox recording of London Assurance by Dion Boucicault. Read in English by LibriVox Volunteers. This fast-paced Victorian farce is at heart a comedy of manners. Dion Bouciault’s witty dialogue ridicules the pretensions of society as the plot sets up the unpleasant initial situation of the aging, vain Sir Harcourt Courtly being set by a special provision of her father’s will to marry 18-year-old Grace Harkaway. The situation quickly escalates upon their arrival at Oak Hall to seal the engagement as more increasingly zany minor characters are added and romantic complications ensue. Double courtship and comic deception abound in this high-spirited comedy. (Summary by Kelly S.

Even with the best intentions, we can often get caught up in the affairs of this world and forget about God. To stay on the path to Heaven we must make, from time to time, an examination of our life's heading. This collection of essays reminds us to live for God rather than for ourselves, encourages us to rise above the concerns and cares of our daily life, and places God's existence - rather than possessions or success - as the true meaning of our lives. . . . While he was the superior of the young Jesuits at Manresa House, Roehampton, Rev. Alban Goodier wrote these essays in 1913 for the newly-launched Stella Maris Magazine, a monthly Jesuit periodical published by Campion House, Osterley. The collection was published as a book the following year by Burns Oates & Washbourne, bearing a Nihil Obstat and Imprimatur. - Summary by Judith Ignacio For further information,...;['Alban Goodier, S.J.'];2021-07-23T00:00:00Z;['eng'];10505;681754901;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'life', 'Catholic', 'christian', 'spirituality', 'meaning', 'jesuit'];audio;https://archive.org/details/meaningoflife_2107_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, life, Catholic, christian, spirituality, meaning, jesuit;2021-07-23;4;10505;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/meaningoflife_2107_librivox/MeaningLife_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (110MB)'}]

The Bostock family were famous in England at the time, for traveling around the country with a bevy of wild animals, many not seen before in provincial towns. If these animals could be trained to perform ""tricks"", rather than behave more naturally, so much the better. This volume gives an insight into the training and care of assorted animals. - Summary by Lynne Thompson For further information, including links to online text, reader information, RSS feeds, CD cover or other formats (if available), please go to the LibriVox catalog page for this recording.

She loves nature and, especially, birds, and thus the title. The story is set in Tennessee. The writing is very much a product of its place and time. Hammond was quite socially progressive but some of the language she puts into the mouths of characters and the depiction of African Americans may be upsetting to some readers.

Read in English by realisticspeakers This 1904 book by composer, conductor and pianist Felix Weingartner examines the development of the symphony as a musical form since one of its greatest practitioners, Ludwig van Beethoven. Beethoven's symphonic works gave the symphony an unprecedented importance as an art form and inspired his contemporaries and later composers to take it more seriously. Weingartner helped create a widespread appreciation for Beethoven's symphonies through his writings on, and performances of, these works. He conducted all of Beethoven's symphonies, and was the first conductor to make commercial recordings of all nine of them.

After much thought and some hesitation I have done so. The former work was meant to be complete in itself, presenting not merely the night-side of tribulation, but bringing out also, though less prominently, some of its day-hues. As, however, it has been thought incomplete, having in it so much more of night than of clay; an endeavour has been made to complete it by drawing forward the eye to the scenes of morning, so soon to open upon us, in all their breadth and beauty. In this way we are led to forget the things that are behind, and to reach forward to those before, pressing towai-ds the mark for the prize of our high calling.

He was said to have been remarkably unclever, but prone to miraculous levitation and intense ecstatic visions that left him gaping.  Joseph began to experience ecstatic visions as a child, which were to continue throughout his life, and made him the object of scorn. He applied to the Conventual Franciscan friars, but was rejected due to his lack of education. He then pleaded with them to serve in their stables. After several years of working there, he had so impressed the friars with the devotion and simplicity of his life that he was admitted to their Order, destined to become a Catholic priest, in 1625.

Read in English by realisticspeakers This 1904 book by composer, conductor and pianist Felix Weingartner examines the development of the symphony as a musical form since one of its greatest practitioners, Ludwig van Beethoven. Beethoven's symphonic works gave the symphony an unprecedented importance as an art form and inspired his contemporaries and later composers to take it more seriously. Weingartner helped create a widespread appreciation for Beethoven's symphonies through his writings on, and performances of, these works. He conducted all of Beethoven's symphonies, and was the first conductor to make commercial recordings of all nine of them.

Read in English by Bruce Kachuk This stirring collection of inspirational war-time poems by the renowned author Richard le Gallienne, offers an insightful examination of a world forced to endure one of the most trying and tragic times in history. In these magnificent poems we witness first hand the pathos of humanity torn apart by World War I, a war like no other, a war affecting all walks of life and inspiring acts of courage, self-sacrifice and gallantry on a scale previously unknown. This was a war that brought society together in ways formerly inconceivable, that brought classes together, that brought souls and spirits together to fight for a cause that was deemed honorable, righteous and just. This was also a war that brought nations to their knees and people to the abyss of despair. The remarkable skill of le Gallienne takes the reader to the brink of his own despair and frustration,...;['Richard le Gallienne'];2021-12-07T00:00:00Z;['eng'];18880;55967013;['librivox', 'audiobooks', 'patriotism', 'hope', 'loyalty', 'determination', 'courage', 'gallantry', 'poetry of war', 'deprivation'];audio;https://archive.org/details/silkhat_soldier_2112_librivox;librivox, audiobooks, patriotism, hope, loyalty, determination, courage, gallantry, poetry of war, deprivation;2021-12-07;1;18880;[{'url': 'https://archive.org/download/silkhat_soldier_2112_librivox/SilkHatSoldier_librivox.m4b', 'text': 'M4B Audiobook (8MB)'}]

Have you ever watched a soap bubble drifting up on the air, sparkling and lovely? These lovely stories for children are of many lengths and varied styles but all beautifully crafted, just like the soap bubbles we blow and enjoy watching our children blow. Unlike soap bubbles however, these stories can be enjoyed over and over again by children of all ages. The style is indeed a bit old, but fairy tales should be kind of timeless, shouldn't they? ""All the afternoon the children, pipe in hand, with soap suds before them, had been blowing airy bubbles that caught the gleams of a hundred flying rainbows—but now in the fading daylight, the pipes were put aside, and they threw themselves down on the fur rug, and looked with thoughtful eyes into the caverns of the fire. ""What can we do now?"" they cried, ""Won't you make us some bubbles?""

Read in English by Availle After her mother's death, Letty is forced to move in with her only relative, cousin Bev. From the start, the naive 18-year-old finds it difficult to adjust to life in the tiny homestead of Bev and his family, and her sheltered upbringing has left her unequipped for the hard life on the Texan prairie. Bev's wife is superficially friendly, but sees nothing but a rival in Letty, and although the girl quickly makes friends with the neighbors, she suffers from the loneliness and monotony of her daily life. But worst of all is the harsh environment Letty finds at her new home. The vast, drought stricken prairie with nothing but yellowish grass and sand for miles is in stark contrast to the lush greens of Virginia, where the girl grew up. And then there is the wind, the never ceasing wind who fills with sand every nook and cranny of home, body, and mind.

Abundant in these works is the poet's empathy with the plight of mankind whom she envisions as trapped on a treadmill, vainly attempting to escape the traditional but remaining caught and destined - albeit while on the very threshold of an existence shaped by the reality of the struggle - to re-emerge into a world which is in a profusion of anguishing ways dishearteningly similar to that of before.
